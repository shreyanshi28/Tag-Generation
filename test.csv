P. Venkatarama Reddi, J.

1. The opinion recorded by the Kerala High Court in ITR No. 16 of 1997 has given rise to this appeal filed by the Chief Commissioner of Income-tax. The dispute relates to the assessment year 1985-86. At the instance of the Revenue the following question was referred under Section 256(1) of the Income tax Act for the opinion of the High Court:

""Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal is right in law and fact in holding that Rs. 3,02,758/- cannot be brought to tax and in doleting the addition of Rs. 3,02,758/- sustained by CIT (Appeals)?""

The High Court accepted the view of the Tribunal which partly allowed the appeal of the assessee and answered the question in favour of the assessee.

2. The facts in brief are: The respondent-assessee is engaged in the business of tea, spices etc. During the assessment year 1985-86 (previous year ending on 31.3.1985) the assessee 'wrote-back' in its accounts a sum of Rs. 14,65,997/- representing the provision made during earlier years (1978-1981) towards its purchase tax liability. It appears that the liability to pay purchase tax on certain goods was in dispute and, therefore, the provision was made. Further, it appears that the assessee, in support of its claim for purchase tax relief, inter alia, relied on the decision of the Kerala High Court in Neroth Oil Mills' case. The SLP filed by the Kerala State against the decision of the High Court in the said case was rejected by this Court in November, 1984. Apparently, for that reason, the assessee thought it fit to reverse the provision made earlier towards purchase tax and therefore made the entries in the books of account during the year ending on 31.3.1985. The assessing officer added the sum of Rs. 14,65,997/- which represents the provision made towards purchase tax during the assessment years 1978-79, 1979-80 and 1980-81, treating the same as the income of the previous year ending on 31.3.1985. In the first appeal, the CIT (Appeals) held that there was no justification to include the sums which were already included in the course of reassessments made for the years 1979-80 and 1980-81. However, he upheld the addition of Rs. 3,02,758 pertaining to the assessment year 1978-79. The Appellate Commissioner held that the liability of the assessee finally ceased during the year 1985-86 in view of the rejection of SLP in Neroth Oil Mills' case in November 1984. Certain observations were also made as regards the inflexibility of the sums pertaining to assessment years 1980-81 and 1981-82 in respect of which reassessments were made. However, in this appeal, we need not go into the details thereof.

3. On further appeal by the assessee, the Tribunal set aside the addition of Rs. 3,02,758/- which was upheld by the Appellate Commissioner. The Tribunal did not agree with the view taken by the first Appellate Authority that there was no cessation of liability within the meaning of Section 41(1) of the Income-tax Act during the relevant year on account of dismissal of SLP in another case. The Tribunal observed that for claiming exemption from purchase tax on the ground that transaction was in the course of export, two conditions were required to be fulfilled: (1) things purchased and exported are one and the same and (2) the purchases were against firm orders for export. Neroth Oil Mills'case was concerned only with the first aspect and not the second aspect. Therefore, the Tribunal observed that the judgment in Neroth Oil Mills' case, even if it had attained finality does not put an end to the disputed issue involved in the respondent-assessee's case. The Tribunal further noticed that as late as 1993, the sales tax department was pursuing the issue relating to purchase tax liability of the assessee from the assessment year 1974-75 onwards and the cases were still pending decision before the Sales Tax Authorities. The Tribunal pointed out that he unilateral action on the part of the assessee in writing-back the amounts could not have the effect of extinguishing the statutory liability. On reference, the High Court approved the view taken by the Tribunal and held that Section 41(1) cannot be invoked in the instant case. Hence, this appeal by revenue by Special leave.

4. It may be noted that the provision was made in the books of account towards purchase tax which was under dispute and the benefit of deduction from business income was availed of in the past years in relation thereto. The same was sought to be reversed by the assessee during the year ending on 31.3.1985 for whatever reason it be. The question is whether the circumstances contemplated by Section 41(1) exists so as to enable the Revenue to take back what has been allowed earlier as business expenditure and to include such amount in the income of the relevant assessment year i.e. 1985-86. In order to apply Section 41(1) in the context of the facts obtaining in the present case, the following points are to be kept in view : (1) In the course of assessment for an earlier year, allowance or deduction has been made in respect of trading liability incurred by the assessee; (2) Subsequently, a benefit is obtained in respect of such trading liability by way of remission or cessation thereof during the year in which such event occurred; (3) in that situation the value of benefit accruing to the assessee is deemed to be the profit and gains of business which otherwise would not be his income; and (4) such value of benefit is made chargeable to income tax as the income of the previous year wherein such benefit was obtained. The High Court, agreeing with the Tribunal, rightly held that the resort to Section 41(1) could arise only if the liability of the assessee can be said to have ceased finally without the possibility of reviving it. On the facts found by the Tribunal, the Tribunal as well as the High Court were well justified in coming to the conclusion that the purchase tax liability of the assessee had not ceased finally during the year in question. Despite the finality attained by the judgment in Neroth Oil Mills'case, the other issues having bearing on the exigibility of purchase tax still remained and the dispute between the assessee and the sales-tax department was still going on. There is no material on record to rebut these factual observations made by the Tribunal. Nor can it be said that the reasons given by the Tribunal are irrelevant.

5. The learned senior counsel appearing for the Income Tax Department has contended that the assessee itself took steps to write-off the liability on account of purchase tax by making necessary adjustments in the books, which itself is indicative of the fact that the liability ceased for all practical purposes and therefore, the addition of amount of Rs. 3,20,758/- deeming the same as income of the year 1985-86 under Section 41(1) is well justified of the Act. But, what the assessee has done is not conclusive. As observed by the Tribunal, an unilateral action on the part of the assessee by way of writing-off the liability in its accounts does not necessarily mean that the liability ceased in the eye of law. In fact, this is the view taken by this Court in CIT v. Suguli Sugar Works(P) Ltd. MANU/SC/0077/1999MANU/SC/0077/1999 : [1999]236ITR518(SC) . We, therefore, find no substance in the contention advanced on behalf of the appellant. Incidentally, we may mention that the controversy relates to the period anterior to the introduction of Explanation 1 to Section 41(1).

6. The decision of this Court in Commissioner of Income Tax v. T.V. Sundaram Iyengar and Sons Ltd. MANU/SC/1251/1996MANU/SC/1251/1996 : [1996]222ITR344(SC) has been cited by the learned counsel for the appellant. We find no relevance of this decision to the determination of the question involved in the present case. The factual matrix and the provision of law considered therein is entirely different.

7. For the reasons aforesaid, we affirm the opinion expressed by the High Court and dismiss the appeal filed by the Revenue. There shall be no order as to costs.

G.B. Pattanaik, J.

1. This batch of Special Leave Petitions are by the State of Tamil Nadu, directed against the Judgment of the Division Bench of Madras High Court, dealing with the licensing system for retail vending of Indian made foreign liquor. The Excise Year is for the period of 1st of August of the year in question till the 31st of July of the next year. In June, 2001, the Government of Tamil Nadu came forward with a Policy to be adopted for licensing of the Indian made foreign liquor retail vending shops for the block period 2001-2004. The said Policy was issued under G.O.Ms. No. 113. For the aforesaid block period, it was decided that the retail vending shops for the entire State should be fixed at 6000 and the privilege fee shall be worked out on the notified area basis, taking the average privilege fee of the last three years and providing for some suitable increase. It was also stipulated that the licensee should lift the minimum off-take fixed for the shop by the licensing authority and in case of failure to lift the same, the licensee will be liable to pay a penalty in proportion to the loss of revenue due to non-lifting of stocks and if there is still further default, then the licence would be liable to be cancelled. In accordance with the aforesaid policy decision, amendments to the Tamil Nadu Liquor (Retail Vending) Rules, 1989 were made, which were issued under G.O.Ms. No. 115 dated 22nd of June, 2001. The Prohibition Commissioner also recommended a new licensing system for grant of licenses to the Indian made foreign liquor retail vending shops for the block year 2001-2004, which was accepted by the State Government and the necessary amendments to the Retail Vending Rules were made. Under Rule 13 of the amended rules, when the number of eligible applications does not exceed the number of shops notified for an area, then all applicants shall be selected for the grant of privilege. But when the number of applications in respect of the shops in a notified area is more then the number of shops in that area, the selection of applicant for grant of privilege shall be decided by drawal of lot by the licensing authority in the presence of the Collector and the applicants who prefer to be present. Rule 14 of the amended rules provided that privilege amount be fixed by the Commissioner, on the basis of the guidelines approved by the Government. Rule 30(2) provides for the lifting of the minimum off-take of the liquor fixed for the shops by the licensing authority based on the guidelines issued by the Government and the consequences to follow, in case the licensee fails to lift the minimum off-take. Sub-rule (7) of Rule 30 provides that the applicant on being granted licence, shall abide by the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition Act, 1937, as well as the Tamil Nadu Liquor (Retail Vending) Rules, 1989, as amended from time to time and the terms and conditions of the licence granted thereunder.

2. In accordance with the aforesaid Excise Policy and the provisions of the Act and the Rules, the exclusive privilege in respect of different retail vending shops of Indian made foreign liquor were settled with the applicants and licences were also issued by the licensing authority in favour of them for carrying on the business. Even though the policy was for the block period of 2001-2004 and an existing licensee could apply for renewal of his licence, for the excise year 2002-2003, the Government of Tamil Nadu changed the policy by issuance of three G.O.Ms. of the same date being G.O.Ms. Nos. 128, 129 and 130. The aforesaid three G.O.Ms. indicate that the Government felt that there is a need for increasing the number of shops in unserved areas that are not notified and also in the existing notified areas where there is further potential and demand identified by the Collectors. It was also indicated that the privilege amount in respect of the shops located in areas adjoining the Corporations and Municipalities could be enhanced and as such there is a need to re-categorize the shops and to re-fix the privilege amount. The Commissioner of Prohibition and Excise also suggested that along with the increase in the number of notified shops and re-fixation of the privilege amount for the shops located in peripheral areas of Corporations/Municipalities, as well as the revision of privilege amount for augmenting the excise revenue, the Government should consider whether instead of renewing the licences of the existing licensees, all the shops may be allotted afresh in accordance with earlier G.O.Ms. No. 115 dated 22nd of June, 2001. In other words, it suggested to have a fresh draw of lot. In accordance with the aforesaid recommendations contained in G.O.Ms. No. 128, the State Government passed the necessary orders, directing that the provision for renewal of licences prescribed in Rule 14 of the Tamil Nadu Liquor (Retail Vending) Rules, 1989 be repealed and all the 7000 shops including the re-categorized shops shall be disposed of, as per the procedures laid down in G.O.Ms. No. 115 dated 22nd June, 2001. Consequential amendments of certain rules were also made.

3. The existing holders of the privilege in question who had obtained licences for carrying on the business for the excise year 2001-2002, approached the High Court of Madras by filing writ petitions, challenging the validity of the Government Order Nos. 128, 129 and 130. The Learned Single Judge, on entertaining the writ petitions, granted interim orders on 16th of July, 2002, directing ad hoc renewal of licences for a period of three months in respect of the petitioners who had approached the Court. The State preferred the appeal to the Division Bench against the aforesaid interim order of the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench while being in seisin of appeal against the interim order, passed by the Single Judge, brought before it the writ petitions which were pending before the Single Judge and disposed them of together by the impugned judgment dated 24th of July, 2002. On considering the submissions made at the Bar as well as the new excise policy and introduction of G.O.Ms. Nos. 128, 129 and 130, the Division Bench of the High Court came to the conclusion that though the excise policy is a subject of the policy-maker and it relates to a trade, which cannot be claimed as a matter of right by any citizen, but the Court would be entitled to probe into the reasonableness or otherwise of the Governmental orders and examine whether they can be sustained on the touchstone of the arbitrariness. The Division Bench sustained the Government orders, so far as they relate to the fiscal policy of the government and the provisions made therein for augmentation of the excise revenue. It rejected the contention of the privilege holders and held that doctrine of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation will have no application. But so far as the provisions dealing with the abolition of the renewal of the existing licence holders and to follow the procedure in respect of the shops by a fresh lot, the Court came to the conclusion that the aforesaid provision has absolutely no nexus with the object of augmentation of excise revenue and it was only meant to disable the existing licensees from opting for the renewal notwithstanding that the excise policy as enunciated in June, 2001 was for the block period 2001-2004. The Court held the aforesaid revised excise policy to be wholly unreasonable and arbitrary, having no nexus at all with the object of augmentation of excise revenue for which purpose the new policy was introduced. The Court finally disposed of the matter with the following directions:

""(i) The Government is at liberty to go ahead with the grant of privilege of retail vending of Indian Made Foreign liquor to the extent of 7,000 shops as decided.

(ii) But the Government shall adhere to the places of retail vending which have been licenced for the excise year 2001-2002 and held by the petitioners and renew the licence of the petitioners for the excise year 2002-2003 on the petitioners' remittance of the privilege amount on the basis of the amount fixed in G.O.Ms. No. 129 dated 8.7.2002 and also taking into account the re-categorisation of the shops for the purpose of levy of the privilege amount.

(iii) The above facility of renewal to the petitioners shall be made available if the petitioners remit the requisite amounts on or before 31st of July, 2002.

(iv) For any reason, if there is a delay in renewal, the petitioners shall be entitled to vend the Indian Made Foreign Liquor in retail on payment of the proportionate privilege amount till the grant of licence.

(v) The Government, the Commissioner and all the District Collectors shall be entitled to re-locate the shops out of 7,000 at the places they feel expedient, but only after safeguarding the shops which are being run by the petitioners.""

It is this order of the Division Bench of the Madras High Court, which is the subject matter of challenge in all the special leave petitions.

4. After hearing Mr. K.K. Venugopal, the learned senior counsel, appearing for the State of Tamil Nadu at great length and Mr. P. Chidambaram, the learned senior counsel, appearing for the respondents, though we did not find any infirmity with the impugned judgment of the Division Bench of Madras High Court and would have normally dismissed the special leave petitions, but since Mr. Venugopal had advanced a lengthy argument and certain directions given in the impugned judgment require modulation, we thought it appropriate to notice and answer the same, while dismissing the special leave petitions.

5. Mr. K.K. Venugopal, the learned senior counsel, appearing for the State contended that there is no inherent right in a citizen to sell intoxicating liquor by retail and it is not a privilege of a citizen. As it is a business attended with danger to the community, it may be entirely prohibited or be permitted under such conditions as will limit to the utmost its evils. The legislature of a state or the executive government is fully competent to regulate the business of vending intoxicating liquor to mitigate its evils or to suppress it entirely. That being the right of a citizen to deal with the liquor and by the impugned orders the State Government having altered the existing policy for augmentation of excise revenue, the same could not have been interfered with by the High Court. Mr. Venugopal also further contended that there is no right of renewal of the licences with the grantee of the privilege and the amended provisions having been engrafted for the new excise year, the High Court committed error in holding the same to be arbitrary. In support of this contention, reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in the case of Madras City Wine Merchants' Association and Anr. v. State of Tamil Nadu and Anr., MANU/SC/0815/1994MANU/SC/0815/1994 : 1992(60)ELT674(SC) . According to Mr. Venugopal, in accordance with the Rules in force, the existing licensees having failed to lift the minimum off-take quantity of liquor, the State has suffered a loss in excise revenue and, therefore, for augmentation of the excise revenue, a new set of policy having been formulated in respect of a trade over which no citizen can claim a fundamental right, the Court was not justified in interfering with the same on the ground that the decision to have a fresh lot for all the shops is arbitrary and unreasonable.

6. Mr. Chidambaram, the learned senior counsel appearing for the existing licensees, on the other hand contended that the High Court was fully justified in striking down only that part of the government order which was held to have no nexus with the object of augmentation of excise revenue. He further contended that the licensees are agreeable to pay the privilege fee as decided by the Government and also would be bound by the limit of off-take of liquor to be decided by the excise authorities. According to Mr. Chidambaram, there is no error in the impugned judgment, which requires any interference by this Court in exercise of powers under Article 136 of the Constitution.

7. We have carefully considered the rival submissions at the Bar as well as the decision cited in support of the contention raised. So far as the trade in noxious or dangerous goods are concerned, no citizen can claim to have trade in the same and the intoxicating liquor being a noxious material, no citizen can claim any inherent right to sell intoxicating liquor by retail. It cannot be claimed as a privilege of a citizen of a State. That being the position, any restriction which the State brings forth, must be a reasonable restriction within the meaning of Article 19(6) and reasonableness of the restriction would differ from trade to trade and no hard and fast rule concerning all trades can be laid down. The Government of Tamil Nadu does not purport to abolish the trade in intoxicating liquor and what is purports to do is to change its policy intended for augmentation of excise revenue. With that end in view under the new set of Government orders, there have been large number of shops to deal with retail vending of Indian made foreign liquor, there has been re-categorisation of the shops, there has been re-adjustment and relocation of the retail shops, there has been increase in the amount of privilege fee and the High Court has upheld all these conditions on the ground that they relate to the augmentation of excise revenue. But so far as the right of renewal is concerned, the same having been unequivocally indicated in the excise policy of 2001-2002, as reflected in G.O.Ms. No. 115 for the block period of 2001-2004, the State Government could not have annulled the same and directing afresh the self same procedure to be adopted again by drawal of lots for settling of the privileges in respect of 7,000 shops inasmuch as that has nothing to do with the augmentation of excise revenue. To our query, as to how this should be helpful in achieving the augmentation of excise revenue, Mr. Venugopal was not able to satisfy us and in our view, the High Court rightly came to the conclusion that the aforesaid decision was nothing but an arbitrary and whimsical one taken by the State Government, only to replace the existing licensees by a fresh set of persons by a fresh drawal of lot. Even though the licensees under the earlier policy may not claim an absolute right of renewal but it cannot be denied that under G.O.Ms. No. 115 read with the excise policy evolved for the block period 2001-2004 and the relevant provisions of the Act and Rules, contemplate a case of renewal and this is also apparent from the recommendations of the Excise Commissioner himself on the basis of which the State Government came forward with the revised policy and a new set of rules by enacting G.O.Ms. Nos. 128, 129 and 130. We have, therefore, no hesitation in affirming the conclusion of the Division Bench of the Madras High Court that the portions of G.O.Ms. dealing with the non-renewal of the privileges granted to the existing licensees subject to their fulfilling the other conditions of the provisions of the Act and the rules to be arbitrary. We are, therefore, not persuaded to interfere with the conclusion of the High Court, so far as it deals with the dispensing with the right of renewal of the existing licensees under the present set of G.O.Ms. which fell before the High Court for consideration. Necessarily, therefore, the appropriate excise authority will have to decide the case of the applicants for renewal of the licences in accordance with the Rules as well as the other conditions of the licences.

Mr. Chidambaram very fairly stated that none of the respondents have any grievances to be governed by the rules and conditions of licence including the conditions providing for a minimum off-take. But the manner in which the High Court has issued the directions, appears to us not to be in conformity with the rules for issuance of a mandamus. Once the court comes to the conclusion that certain provisions of the Act or the Rules of the Government order is arbitrary, then the Court would strike down the same, leaving the matter for the appropriate authority under the statute to deal with the cases of applicants. In that view of the matter, the directions contained in Clause (ii), Clause (iii) and Clause (iv) require modulation. We therefore, substitute the aforesaid clauses of the impugned judgment by the following directions:

8. The competent authority/the State Government shall consider the application for renewal of the licence in accordance with law and would be entitled to include all conditions in the licence, including the condition of minimum off-take. Needless to mention that the licensees of the privileges would be bound by the enhancement of the privilege amount as well as the re-categorisation of the shops contained in the three G.O.Ms., referred to earlier. it is also made clear that the facility of the renewal would be available to those of the existing licensees, who had remitted the requisite amount on or before 31st of July, 2002, as ordered by the High Court itself. We also further direct that the privilege fee already paid by these licensees for the Excise Year 2002-2003 shall be duly adjusted. Clauses (i) and (v) of the directions contained in the impugned judgment shall remain as it is.

9. Mr. Venugopal had referred to an affidavit which had been filed in this Court by the Secretary to the Government of Tamil Nadu, Prohibition and Excise Department, wherein it had been stated that the State Government will be willing to consider the grant of renewal in favour of the existing licensees, subject to their giving an undertaking to this court that they would abide by the rules and conditions relating to the minimum off-take during the current year as well as previous excise year 2001-2002 and would withdraw the writ petitions filed by them, which are pending in the High Court of Madras. So far as the minimum off-take for the excise year 2002-2003 is concerned, Mr. Chidambaram, appearing for the respondents, fairly stated that the respondents would abide by the same. But so far as the minimum off-take for the previous excise year is concerned, the same not having been there at the time of grant of the privilege and issuance of licence, but having been introduced at a later point of time, the legality of the same is the subject matter of consideration before the High Court of Madras and we express no opinion on the same.

10. These special leave petitions are accordingly dismissed with the modulated directions, as stated earlier.

1. After hearing the Learned Counsel for both the parties at length, we find ourselves in agreement with the view taken by the Customs, Excise & Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as 'CESTAT') in the impugned judgment [2006 (204) E.L.T. 61 (Tribunal)] that the product of the Appellant herein known as ""Baygon Mosquito Specialist"" is covered by Serial No. 37 (i.e., 'Mosquito coils, mats and other mosquito repellants') of Notification No. 9/2000-C.E. (N.T.) : MANU/CUST/0040/2000, dated 1-3-2000. Since this Notification is issued Under Section 4A of the Central Excise Act, 1944, the Revenue rightly assessed the Excise duty under the aforesaid provision. Finding no merit in any of these appeals, the same are dismissed.

"
"

1. This appeal is directed against the judgment and order passed by the High Court of Karnataka in Criminal Appeal No. 473 of 2002, dated 28.02.2008, whereby and where under the High Court has set aside the judgment and order of acquittal passed by the Trial Court in SPL.C.C. No. 47 of 2000. The brief facts of the case are that the Appellant was the Village Accountant of Tavarekere, Bangalore South Taluk. The complainant (PW-1) had applied for, and received, a mutation copy in respect of certain joint family property. However, since his mother's name had not been added in the same, he requested the Appellant to effect the necessary changes. The Appellant demanded a sum of ` 500/- as bribe in exchange for making the said change and asked PW-1 to bring the said amount to his office on 06.04.1999. PW-1 lodged a complaint before the Lokayukta Office and trap proceedings were conducted, including smearing currency notes produced by PW-1 with phenolphthalein powder.

2. Accordingly, on 06.04.1999, PW-1 met the Appellant and, on him demanding the amount, handed over the said currency notes to the Appellant. On PW-1's signal, the trap team arrived at the scene and seized the said amount from the Appellant. The sodium carbonate test was done on the Appellant hands which tested positive. The Appellant's bag was also seized and a trap Mahazar was made.

3. The investigation was completed and a charge sheet against the Appellant for offences Under Section 7 and Section 13(1)(d) read with 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (for short, ""the Act"") was filed before the Trial Court. The Appellant appeared before the Trial Court. The charges were read over and explained to the Appellant who pleaded not guilty. Consequently, the case was committed to trial.

4. The prosecution examined seven witnesses and produced eight documents and 11 material objects, while no witnesses were produced by the defense. The Appellant's statement was recorded Under Section 313(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short, ""the Code""). The defense also produced two documents.

5. The Trial Court considered the evidence on record as also the arguments of the parties and noticed that the prosecution case suffered from several infirmities and that the testimonies of PW-1 and the Investigating Officer (PW-7) were not credible. The Trial Court further noticed that the shadow witness in this case (PW-2) was a ""stock witness"" and had previously given similar testimonies in other cases as well. The Trial Court reasoned that it was likely that the Appellant's hands had come in contact with the currency notes when PW-1 had handed over the application documents to him. In light of these considerations, the Trial Court, by judgment and order dated 29.11.2001, acquitted the Appellant.

6. Aggrieved by the said acquittal, the Respondent-State approached the High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 473/2002 on the ground, inter alia, that the Trial Court had not correctly appreciated the evidence on record and that the defects noted by the Trial Court did not, in and of themselves, discredit the case of the prosecution.

7. By the impugned judgment and order dated 28.02.2008, the High Court re-appreciated the entire evidence on record and noticed that though there were certain discrepancies in the testimonies of P.Ws. 1, 2, 6 (official witness) and 7 (Investigating Officer), the same were of a minor nature and would not disprove the entire case of the prosecution. Therefore, the High Court set aside the order passed by the Trial Court and convicted the Appellant for offences Under Section 7 and Section 13(1)(d) read with 13(2) of the Act and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of ` 5000/- for the offence Under Section 13(1)(d) read with 13(2) of the Act. No sentence was awarded for the offence Under Section 7 of the Act.

8. Aggrieved by the judgment and order passed by the High Court, the Appellant is before us in this appeal.

9. We have heard learned Counsel for the parties to the lis.

10. Learned Counsel for the Appellant would submit that PW-2's testimony does not support the prosecution's case and, therefore, cannot be relied on. He further submits that the prosecution has failed to prove the factum of demand and that mere recovery of the said amount will not, in and of itself, establish the Appellant's guilt.

11. After carefully perusing the evidence on record, including the judgments and orders passed by the Courts below the Appellant's case fails to convince us. The testimony of PW-1 corroborates that of PW-7. Further, the discrepancies pointed out by the Trial Court are minor in nature and do not by themselves disprove the prosecution case. The Trial Court judgment is based on mere conjectures and surmises and was correctly set aside by the High Court.

12. On the question of sentence, the learned Counsel further submits that in light of the Appellant's advanced age, the sentence imposed ought to be reduced to the period of sentence undergone, i.e., three months. However, taking into consideration the seriousness of the offence and the fact that the minimum sentence for the said offences is one year, we are of the considered opinion that the sentence imposed cannot be further reduced.

13. In light of the aforesaid, we are of the considered opinion that the judgment and order passed by the High Court does not suffer from any infirmity whatsoever and does not require our interference. The appeal, being devoid of any merit, is liable to be dismissed and is dismissed accordingly. The bail bonds of the Appellant shall stand cancelled and the Appellant is directed to be taken into custody forthwith to serve out the remaining period of sentence.

Ordered accordingly.

"

1. An issue raised by the appellants was that the search was conducted both in their shop and in their house and that the search warrant was limited to the shop. The Panchas to the search were, therefore, material witnesses in this behalf. That they were not produced for cross-examination, though asked for, is not disputed. There has, therefore, in our view, clearly been a breach of natural justice. On this count alone, the order of the High Court must be set aside. We are unimpressed by the argument that no prejudice was caused to the appellants by reason of the non-production of the Panchas which, it would appear, was what the High Court seemed to think.

2. The civil appeal is allowed. The judgment and order under appeal is set aside.

No order as to costs.

1. By these four appeals, we are called upon to consider the legality, correctness and validity of the impugned Notification dated 7.12.2000 appointing Shri N.A. Acharya as the President of the Industrial Court at Ahmedabad. A Notification dated 7.12.2000. In this regard, was issued by the order of Governor by the Labour and Employment Department of the Government of Gujarat in the Gujarat Government Gazette whereby Shri N.A. Acharya had been appointed as the President of the Industrial Court which was under challenge before the High Court of Gujarat in Special Civil Application Nos. 12665/2000, 79/2001, 80/2001 and 93/2001 filed by Gujarat Kishan Mazdoor Panchayat, Gujarat Industrial Court Judges' Association Labour Laws Practitioners Association and Surat Textile Labour Union. As per the directions of the Chief Justice, the applicants were placed before the Full Bench of the Gujarat High Court. The Full Bench, by its judgment dated 4.5.2001, allowed the applications and quashed the said Notification dated 7.12.2000. The Full Bench further directed the respondents to proceed to make the appointment afresh on the post of the President of the Industrial Court, Gujarat in the light of what has been held in the said order and in accordance with law. Aggrieved by the order passed by the Full Bench of the High Court, the High Court of Gujarat through its Registrar preferred Special Leave Petition (c) Nos. 11795-11798/2001 on the grounds raised in the special leave petitions. By order dated 14.12.2001, this Court granted leave and made the interim order absolute.

2. All these appeals involve common question of law based on some set of facts, therefore, we propose to decide these appeals by a common judgment. A Special Civil Application was filed by the Gujarat Kishan Mazdoor Panchayat, a Registered Trade Union to direct the respondents therein not to make any appointments on the post of President of the Industrial Court save and except by appointing any Member of the Industrial Court as President and other allied reliefs. A prayer to issue a writ of quo warranto was also asked for to direct Shri N.A. Acharya - respondent No.3 in the application to state the basis of his right to be appointed as President of the Industrial Court and to set aside and quash the appointment order dated 7.12.2000 purporting to appoint Shri N.A. Acharya as President of the Industrial Court.

3. The brief facts leading to the filing of the applications are briefly stated as under:

4. The Bombay Industrial Relations Act, 1946 (hereinafter referred to as ""the B.I.R. Act"") governs the relationship between the employers and workmen in several industries operating in Gujarat and more particularly, the Industry of Textile, the Industry of Power in the late Bombay State area of Gujarat, the Surat Industry, the Banking Industry run by Banking Companies having no branches outside the State of Gujarat. Sections 9 and 10 of the B.I.R. Act thereof provide for setting up of Labour Courts and Industrial Court. Section 10 of the B.I.R. Act, which pertains to the setting up of a Court of Industrial Arbitration to be known as Industrial Court, is provided to consist of three or more Members, one of whom shall be its President. Section 10(4) of the B.I.R. Act provides that every Member of the Industrial Court shall be a person who is or has been a Judge of High Court or is eligible for being appointed a Judge of such Court provided inter alia, that a person who has been a Judge not lower in rank than that of Assistant Judge, for not less than three years; or a person who has been the Presiding Officer of a Labour Court for not less than five years shall also be eligible for appointment as a Member of the Industrial Court. According to the respondents, there are twelve Members of the Industrial Court. According to the respondents, there are twelve Members of the Industrial Court functioning in Gujarat State and so far as the Labour Courts are concerned, there are 38 Judges functioning in Gujarat, four of them are Judges who have completed more than ten years since as Labour Judges and several more Labour Judges are those who have completed more than five years' service as Labour Judges and are, therefore, eligible for being appointed as Members of the Industrial Court. When the post of President of the Industrial Court was vacant since the retirement of Shri D.V. Joshi, Shri Y.P. Bhatt, the senior-most Member of the Industrial Court expressed his unwillingness to be appointed as President of the Industrial Court, the post was, therefore, required to be filled up by a regular appointment. According to the respondents, a person for being appointed as President should be a Member of the Industrial Court and no one except a Member can be appointed as a President of the Industrial Court. It was, therefore, submitted before the High Court that anyone from the Members of the Industrial Court can be considered to be eligible for being appointed as President. It was further submitted that in view of the scheme of Section 10(2) of the B.I.R. Act, no one who is not a Member of the Industrial Court can be directly appointed as President of the Industrial Court. It was further argued before the High Court that for Members of the Industrial Court there is no other avenue of promotion except one by way of appointment as President of the Industrial Court and now, if the post of President is to be filled up by binding someone from Judicial Service, it will cause a great frustration among Members of the Industrial Court as their hopes of promotion at an appropriate time will be dashed to the ground. Opposing the applications, it was submitted by the respondents, appellant herein that no illegality was committed by recommending the name of Shri N.A. Acharya for appointment as the President of the Industrial Court and that under Rules 2 and 3 of the Draft Recruitment Rules, it has become necessary for the High Court, on its administrative side, to recommend the appointment of an appropriate person by nomination on the said post under Rule 2(b) and that Shri N.A. Acharya, whose name was recommended, is fulfilling the criteria prescribed by the Government as per the old Rules as well. it was submitted that considering the totality of the facts, the High Court of Gujarat had not only acted within its rights but the same had been done in due discharge of the Constitution duty. The petitioners, respondents herein, filed their rejoinder to the reply affidavit on behalf of the High Court of Gujarat reiterating the contentions raised in the applications. In the rejoinder affidavit, it was submitted that neither the appointment order nor the reply affidavit filed on behalf of the High Court shows that the appointment was made by the Governor of the State and that there is nothing to show that the Full Court was consulted by the appointing authority before making the appointment. It was further stated that assuming that the appointment by nomination can be made on the post of a President of the Industrial Court either under the old Rules pertaining to the post of President or under the new Rules which are at the draft stage only, the candidate concerned should have atleast for ten years either held a judicial post in India or should have been an advocate for High Court or should have expert knowledge of Industrial matters. According to the petitioners, respondents herein, the appointee, under the impugned appointment had not hold a judicial post for ten years and in fact he was holding the post of Joint District Judge only and he had not even completed three years on the post of Additional District Judge to which post he was directly recruited. It was, therefore, submitted that the appointment had been made without coming to the conclusion that the appointee was fulfilling the criteria for appointment as required by the Rules. An affidavit in reply was filed before the High Court by the Law Officer of the High Court of Gujarat giving all details as to how the matter was considered by the Standing Committee of the High Court and as to how the decision was taken to appoint Shri N.A. Acharya as the President of the Industrial Court.

5. The Full Bench of the High Court, by its judgment, held that a reading of Section 10 of the B.I.R.Act would show that it provides for the constitution of the Industrial Court with three or more Members, one of whom as its President and it also provides the eligibility for appointment as Member of the Industrial Court. While the eligibility has been prescribed under Section 10(3) and (4) of the B.I.R. Act for being a Member of the Industrial Court, for the purpose of President of the Industrial Court all that has been said in Sub-section (2) of Section 10 of the B.I.R. Act is that one of the Members shall be its President. Therefore, being a Member of the Industrial Court is a pre-requisite and condition precedent for being the President of the Industrial Court and no person can be appointed as the President of the Industrial Court unless he is a Member of the Industrial Court. The Full Bench further held that the absence of any Rules with regard to the appointment on the post of President of the Industrial Court except the existing Draft Rules framed by the High Court and the Rules as had been framed under proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution vide Gujarat Government Gazette dated 25.2.1965 being only for recruitment for the post of Member Industrial Court and the Rules for appointment of President, Industrial Court as contained in the Hand Book (1992) that too that in consultation with the High Court the only relevant provision which can be traced is Section 10 of the B.I.R. Act and according to Section 10(2) of the B.I.R. Act one of the Members of the Industrial Court has to be the President. The Full Bench further held that there was no lawful justification for excluding the candidates, who were holding the post of Member, Industrial Court and whereas they have been kept out of consideration on the basis of the proposed Draft Rules, the consideration for making the appointment to the post in question stands vitiated. Elaborating further, the Full Bench held:

In the first instance there is no question of appointment by nomination on the basis of the proposed Draft Rules by holding that existing. Members were not eligible because they have not completed five years as Member. In a given case when the only mode of appointment is promotion and it is found that no one is eligible for appointment by promotion, it may be open to make appointment by direct recruitment which would mean inviting application from all eligible candidates and then making the selection. No such procedure has been followed and the consideration was kept confined to the Members of the Judicial Services, who had conveyed their willingness for appointment as President of the Industrial Court. We find that the procedure which has been adopted and which has led to the impugned appointment is not in conformity either with the general right of equality under Article 14 of the Constitution of India and with the right of equality in matters relating to employment as contemplated by Article 16 of the Constitution of India and, therefore this appointment cannot be sustained in the eye of law.

It is also not in dispute that the respondent No.3 had never been appointed as Member of the Industrial Court and in terms of Section 10(2) of the Bombay Industrial Relations Act without being a Member of the Industrial Court, there is no question of his appointment as the President of the Industrial Court either by promotion or by direct recruitment. Being a Member of the Industrial Court is sine qua non for consideration for the post of President of the Industrial Court and no person who is not a Member of Industrial Court would be considered for appointment as such without committing violence to the recruitment of Section 10(2).

.....In the instant case, we find that the mode of direct recruitment is not contemplated and even if any direct recruitment is held for the post of President of Industrial Court when no Member is eligible, such direct recruitment is required to be held after affording equal opportunity to all those, who are eligible. The proposed Draft Rules 2(a) seeks to render the Members of the Industrial Court to be ineligible by putting the condition of the completion of 5 years service on the post of Member. When the Act has not put any such fetter and the Act contemplates that one of the Members of the Industrial Court shall be the President and it is not stated that he must complete certain years of service as Member, through executive instructions such a requirement could not be pressed so as to defeat the right of consideration of the Members of the Industrial Court for consideration of the post of the President. Under Section 10(2) every Member of the Industrial Court is eligible to be considered for the post of President notwithstanding the number of years of service put in by him as a Member.

In our consideration option Section 10 of the Bombay Industrial Relations Act, 1946 is the only relevant provision to be taken note of for the purpose of appointment of the President and the only mode of appointment is by way of promotion from amongst the Members of the Industrial Court and in this regard. If any Rules are to be framed in exercise of the powers under Chapter VI of Part VI of the Constitution of India, the same cannot be inconsistent with the requirements of the Bombay Industrial Relations Act, 1946.....

6. The High Court, for the reasons stated above, quashed the Notification which is impugned in the applications and further directed the respondents therein to proceed to make the appointment afresh on the post of the President of the Industrial Court, Gujarat in the light of what has been held in the said order and in accordance with law.

7. Aggrieved by the impugned judgment, the above four appeals, by way of special leave petitions were preferred by the High Court of Gujarat. We heard Shri Mahendra Anand, learned senior counsel, for the appellants and Shri R. Venkataramani learned counsel, for the contesting respondents.

8. Learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants submitted that the provisions of Section 10 of the B.I.R. Act clearly spells out that apart from the mode of selecting the President, by promotion from amongst the Members, the President can also directly be appointed from the sitting or retired High Court Judges. He further submitted that the High Court failed to appreciate that Section 10(2) of the B.I.R. Act does not envisage the mode of appointment and that the High Court failed to appreciate that the words of Section 10(2) of the B.I.R. Act are not that the President shall be appointed from one of the current Members of the Industrial Court and therefore, the High Court has erroneously read these words in Section 10(2) of the B.I.R. Act. He further submitted that the High Court failed to appreciate that Section 10(4) of the B.I.R. Act provides for eligibility criteria and Shri N.A. Acharya fulfils the eligibility criteria. He further submitted that the High Court proceeded on an erroneous footing that the B.I.R. Act does not contemplate the appointment by direct recruitment and only the Members of the Industrial Court from the zone of consideration for appointment to the post of President Industrial Court.

9. Per contra, Shri R. Venkataramani, learned senior counsel, appearing for the respondents, apart from reiterating the contentions in the applications, submitted that Section 10(2) of the B.I.R. Act clearly indicates that only Member of Industrial Court is eligible for becoming the President of the Industrial Court and that becoming Member of the Industrial Court is sine qua non for being considered for the post of President of the Industrial Court. According to him, Shri N.A. Acharaya does not fulfil any of the three eligibility conditions mentioned in Section 10(4) of the B.I.R. Act and that mandatory consultation with the Gujarat Public Service Commission was not followed. He further urged that the plain and natural meaning of Section 10(2) of the B.I.R. Act is capable of only one construction and that is only Members of the Industrial Court could become its President. He further submitted that unless one is or has been the Judge of the High Court, the post of the President of the Industrial Court could be filled up only and only by way of promotion, because there exist only one post for the whole State of Gujarat. He further contended that the impugned appointment was void and stillborn since the same was not made by His Excellency, the Governor of Gujarat, but the same was purported to have been made in the name of the Governor of Gujarat. It was further contended that the appointment on a judicial post can be made only by His Excellency, the Governor, under Article 234 of the Constitution of India and the State Government cannot issue Notification appointing Judicial Officer under the business rules by and in the name of His Excellency, the Governor of the State. He further submitted that even assuming the appointment to the post of President can be made through nomination or direct recruitment, all the Members of the Industrial Court were qualified for being appointed as President of the Industrial Court by nomination in accordance with the Draft Rules that were relied upon by the Government supporting the appointment of Shri N.A. Acharya and that the Members of the Industrial Court were eligible for appointment by nomination according to the Draft Rules also and that Rule 2(ii) of the Draft Rules provides, inter alia, that appointment to the post of President shall be made either (a) by promotion from amongst the Members of the Industrial Court on the basis of seniority-comment subject to the provision that for being considered as eligible for such promotion, the Member concerned should have completed five years service as a Member of the Industrial Court; (b) by nomination. Draft Rule 3, inter alia, provides that to be eligible for appointment by nomination a candidate must have attest ten years either held a judicial post in India or been a Advocate of High Court or have expert knowledge of industrial matters. It was further contended that the appointment of Shri N.A. Acharya straightaway by nomination without taking into consideration the cases of nomination of existing Members of the Industrial Court who had completed ten years functioning as a Judicial Officer has been rightly held by the High Court as violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India and that, therefore, no public appointment can be made in disregard of consideration of the cases of those who were qualified for the post.

10. Arguing further, learned senior counsel for the respondents, submitted that the appointment of a Junior Judicial Officer as President of the Industrial Court without considering the cases of existing Members of the Industrial Court who are senior on the basis of longer experience on equivalent post will also not be conducive to the judicial service which, according to him, will result in a Junior Judicial Officer presiding over Industrial Court who have Members far senior to the President and that Junior Judicial Officer will thus exercise administrative powers of control over undisputedly Senior Judicial Officers. It was further submitted that assuming that a District Judge can be directly appointed to the post of President, Industrial Court carrying a higher pay scale than that of the District judges in Gujarat, and assuming that even if somebody is already a Member of the Judiciary, he can be nominated or directly appointed that he did not pass through the channel of promotion or selection meant for those who are already in service in view of Article 234 of the Constitution, even in that case, there was no justification for the High Court on the administrative side to pick up Shri N.A. Acharya who was 9th in the list of seniority at the relevant time. He submitted that the appointment of Shri N.A. Acharya was also vitiated on account of the fact that if nomination or direct recruitment was a permissible course in the matter of appointment of the President of the Industrial Court, then a large number of Labour Court Judges, Advocates apart from the members of the Industrial Court who had completed ten years of practice or seven years of judicial work were also qualified for that appointment and, therefore, they could not be excluded from consideration. Concluding his arguments, he submitted that the High Court's conclusion that Section 10(2) of the B.I.R. Act does not provide for nomination or direct recruitment and someone has to be appointed from amongst the Members of the Industrial Court only is correct and that there is no other provision in the entire B.I.R. Act to provide for the mode of appointment of the President of the Industrial Court. In that view, it is quite reasonable to read Section 10(2) of the B.I.R. Act as providing that President can be appointed only from amongst the Members.

11. We are given our thoughtful consideration on the rival submissions made by the respective counsel appearing on either side. Before proceeding to consider the rival submissions, it is useful to reproduce the relevant provisions governing the controversy which run as follows:

""Section 10. Industrial Court.-(1) The State Government shall constitute a Court of Industrial Arbitration.

(3) Every member of the Industrial Court shall be a person who is not connected with the industrial dispute referred to such court or with any industry directly affected by such dispute.

Provided further that one member of the Industrial Court may be a person not so eligible. If in the opinion of the State Government he possesses expert knowledge of industrial matters.

DRAFT RULES

1. These rules may be called the Recruitment Rules for the post of President, Industrial Court, Gujarat, 1998

2. The appointment of President, Industrial Court, Gujarat, shall be made by the Governor of Gujarat, in consultation with the Public Service Commission and the High Court, either-

12. IN the background of the facts and circumstances and the provisions of law extracted above, the following points arise for consideration by this Court:-

(a) What is the true scope and interpretation of Section 10(2) read with Section 10(4) of the B.I.R. Act?

(b) Whether Section 10(2) of the B.I.R. Act can be read to mean that the President of the Industrial Court must be appointed from among the existing Members of the Industrial Court when the provision in fact is not in such terms?

(c) Whether the reading of the provisions of Section 10 of the B.I.R. Act clearly spells out that apart from the mode of selecting the President, by promotion from amongst the Members, the President can also directly be appointed from the sitting or retired High Court Judges or from the Judges of the City Civil Court, Ahmedabad and District Judges, who fulfills the eligibility requirement for appointment as Member of the Industrial Court?

(d) Whether the High Court has failed to appreciate that Section 10(2) of the B.I.R. Act does not envisage the mode of appointment?

13. Our attention was drawn to the relevant pleadings filed before the High Court and also in this Court.

14. As already noticed, the appointment of Shri N.A. Acharya as the President of the Industrial Court vide Notification dated 7.12.2000 issued by the Labour and Employment Department, Government of Gujarat, is under challenge by way of these appeals. The circumstances and the process, which had culminated in the appointment of Shri N.A. Acharya as the President of the Industrial Court, had been fully narrated in the affidavit in reply filed on behalf of respondent No. 2 in the High Court. Since Shri D.V. Joshi, who was working as the President of the Industrial Court, was to retire on 31.1.2000 and, therefore, the Labour and Employment Department, Government of Gujarat, sent a communication dated 7.1.2000 to the High Court of Gujarat, inter alia, stating therein that, due to the retirement of Shri D.V. Joshi, the post will fall vacant and the question of preparing recruitment Rules for the post of President of the Industrial Court is under consideration by the High Court and till the Rules are not finalized, Government cannot take a decision in respect of the appointment on the said post. Under these circumstances, it was decided to place the matter for consideration of the Standing Committee of the High Court of Gujarat, as to by which mode the post of the President, Industrial Court is to be filled up. Accordingly, the said matter was considered by the Standing Committee of the High Court of Gujarat and it was decided on 8.2.2000 that the post of President, Industrial Court, Ahmedabad, be filled up by nomination under Clause (b) of Rule 2 of the proposed Rules, as none of the present Members of the Industrial Court is eligible to be appointed to the said post by promotion, having not completed five years' service on the post of Member, Industrial Court. The claim of all the incumbents of the post of Member of the Industrial Court was examined in light of the criteria prescribed by the High Court of Gujarat for appointment on the post of President of Industrial Court. It was decided by the Standing Committee to fill up the post of President of the Industrial Court by nomination as stated above. In the light of the decision of the Standing Committee to fill up the post of the President of the Industrial Court by way of nomination, it was further decided to ask for the willingness of the Judicial Officers working in the address of City Court Judges and District Judges, who are not less than 45 years of age and have put in ten years of service in judiciary including the period of practice at the Bar for being considered for appointment in question. Pursuant to the said decision, the willingness was called for and in all, nine judicial officers had expressed willingness for being considered for the post in question, the details of which have been furnished at page 92 of the paper book. Therefore, the said matter was placed for consideration of the Standing Committee of the High Court of Gujarat and in the meeting of the Standing Committee held on 30.3.2000, it was decided to direct the office to resubmit the matter along with the recruitment Rules prescribing eligibility criteria for appointment to the post of President, Industrial Court. Pursuant to the said decision, the matter was again considered in the light of the existing Rule provision by the office. As per the directions of the Standing Committee, the matte was again placed before the Standing Committee for further consideration along with the Rule stated above. In the meeting of the Standing committee of the High Court held on 1.5.2000, the consideration of the subject was deferred, however, in the meantime, the office was directed to resubmit the matter, pointing out the provisions of law in the matter, particularly mentioning the provisions regarding eligibility, experience and age of superannuation etc. prescribed for the post in question. Pursuant to the said direction of the Standing Committee, a detailed note was submitted for consideration of the Standing Committee and after considering all aspects, in the meeting held on 29.6.2000, the Standing Committee had taken decision to the effect that the name of Shri N.A. Acharya, Joint District Judge, Vadodara may be recommended to the Labour and Employment Department, Government of Gujarat, for appointment as President of the Industrial Court, Ahmedabad by nomination provided under the Recruitment Rules for the post in question. Accordingly, the office had sent a communication to the Government on 5.7.2000 recommending the name of Shri N.A. Acharya for appointment on the post of President, Industrial Court, Ahmedabad. Soon after the recommendation was made by the High Court to the Government as aforesaid, a representation was received by the High Court from Shri B.I. Kazi, the President, Gujarat Industrial Judges' Association, Ahmedabad in connection with the filling up of the post of President, Industrial Court, Ahmedabad. In this connection, Shri Kazi was called for personal hearing on 11.8.2000 and he was heard by the Chief Justice on the issue. Again, Shri Y.P. Bhatt, President (In-charge) of the Industrial Court vide his letter dated 4.11.2000 expressed his unwillingness to be promoted as the President of the Industrial Court.

15. On the basis of what is stated above, it is clear that the decision to fill up the post of the President of the Industrial Court by way of nomination as provided under the Rules, was arrived at, after considering all aspects, not only that the process of selecting the person to be recommended to the Government was also undertaken transparently and before taking the decision, the matter was considered from time and again by the Standing Committee of the High Court of Gujarat and after due consideration and deliberations, the decision was taken to recommend the name of Shri N.A. Acharya. Considering the totality of the facts. It is clear to us that there is neither illegality nor arbitrariness in taking the decision of recommending the name of Shri N.A. Acharya for appointment on the post of President, Industrial Court, Ahmedabad.

16. It is seen from the records that at the request of the Government, the eligibility criteria for appointment on the post of President, Industrial Court has been determined by the High Court and the same has been incorporated in the Draft Recruitment Rules. We have already extracted Rules 2 & 3 of the Draft Recruitment Rules. Shri N.A. Acharya is eligible for the p"

P. Venkatarama Reddi, J.

1. In this appeal by Special Leave, the question of applicability of Section 41(1) of the Income Tax Act to the case on hand arises for consideration.

2. For the assessment year 1989-1900, a sum of Rs. 9,64,206/- which is the amount of excise duty refunded by the department was brought to tax by invoking Section 41(1) of the Income Tax Act (for short 'Act'). It appears that the excise duty was paid in the year 1986. On appeal, the first Appellate Authority as well as CEGAT held that the goods were not liable to duty. On 20.9.1988, the excise duty was refunded. On appeal filed to the High Court, it was dismissed. Thereafter, the Excise Department filed SLP in this Court. The fate of the SLP is not known. The appellant contended before the first Appellate Authority that there was no remission or cessation of trading liability within the meaning of Section 41(1) so long as the issue was pending determination by the Supreme Court. That contention was accepted and the appeal was allowed. The appeal filed by the Income Tax Department against the said order was also dismissed. On a reference application filed by the Commissioner of Income Tax the Tribunal referred the following question of law for the opinion of the High Court of Karnataka:

""Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the Tribunal is right in law in holding that excise duty refund is not assessable under Section 41(1) of the I.T. Act.""

The High Court held that the Tribunal was not right in holding that the refunded amount was not assessable under Section 41(1) of the Act. However, the High Court observed that the Tribunal may consider the question whether the excise duty was actually refunded to the assessee or not and pass appropriate orders in the light of its finding. The observation was made after referring to the argument of the assessee's counsel that the amount has not been received by the assessee. In coming to the conclusion that the excise duty refunded was liable to be taxed under Section 41(1) of the Act, the High Court relied on the decision of this Court in C.I.T. v. Thirumalaiswamy Naidu & Sons MANU/SC/0818/1998MANU/SC/0818/1998 : [1998]230ITR534(SC) . This view of the High Court has been questioned in this appeal.

3. The learned counsel for the appellant - assessee submits that the ratio of decision of this Court in Thirumalaiswamy Naidu's case, on which the opinion of the High Court rests, has no application to the present case. As the question of liability to pay excise duty on the goods has not been settled finally during the assessment year in which the refund was obtained, Section 41(1) is not attracted, according to the learned counsel. It is contended, as was contended before the Appellate Authorities and the High Court, that there was no cessation of liability as per Section 41(1) as the issue was pending final adjudication and, therefore, the refunded amount does not form part of the deemed income of the year 1989-1990.

4. It is true that in Thirumalaiswamy Naidu's case the question of interpretation or applicability of any particular limb of Section 41(1) of the Act did not specifically fall for consideration. However, this Court did make it clear that when the assessee actually made payment towards statutory levy (sales tax) and later got back the amount by way of refund as a sequel to the judgment of the High Court, it becomes a revenue receipt and in such a situation, Section 41(1) is clearly attracted. The following are the crucial observation in the judgment:

""The entire amount of sales turnover of the assessee inclusive of the amount of tax collected was clearly includible in the assessee's taxable income. If any deduction was given form that income and later the same was refunded back to the assessee, the refund will have the character of revenue receipt. It has to be treated as a receipt on the revenue account and has to be assessed as such. The position has been placed beyond doubt by the express provisions of Section 41(1) of the Income-tax Act. ""

(Emphasis supplied)

Though there is no elaborate discussion as regards applicability of Section 41(1) of the Act the Court did refer to and rely on that provision in support of its conclusion.

5. Section 41(1), as it stood at the relevant time, reads as follows:

""41(1) Profits chargeable to tax : Where an allowance or deduction has been made in the assessment for any year in respect of loss, expenditure or trading liability incurred by the assessee, and subsequently during any previous year the assessee has obtained, whether in cash or in any other manner whatsoever, any amount in respect of such loss or expenditure or some benefit in respect of such trading liability by way of remission or cessation thereof, the amount obtained by him or the value of benefit accruing to him, shall be deemed to be profits and gains of business or profession and accordingly chargeable to income-tax as the income of that previous year, whether the business or profession in respect of which the allowance or deduction has been made is in existence in that year or not.""

Section 41(1) applies if the following conditions and circumstances are satisfied:

In the assessment for the relevant year an allowance or deduction has been made in respect of any loss, expenditure or trading liability incurred by the assessee. This is the first step. Coming to the next step the assessee must have subsequently (i) obtained any amount in respect of such loss or expenditure or (ii) obtained any benefit in respect of such trading liability by way of remission or cessation thereof. In case either of these events happen, the deeming provision enacted in the closing part of Sub-section (1) comes into play. Accordingly, the amount obtained by the assessee or the value of benefit accruing to him is deemed to be profits and gains of business or profession and it becomes chargeable to income-tax as the income of that previous year.

6. We are of the view, apart from what has been laid down in Thirumalaiswamy Naidu's case (supra), that the ingredients of Section 41(1) are satisfied in the instant case and, therefore the amount of excise duty refunded becomes taxable during the year in question. This is a case in which the assessee can be said to have obtained the amount by way of refund in respect of the business expenditure incurred by it during an earlier year, for which the assessee had the benefit of deduction or allowance. Normally, the payment of certain amount to discharge the statutory levy such as sales tax, excise duty in the course of carrying on business is an expenditure. If authority is needed, we may refer to Kedar Nath Jute Manufacturing Co. v. C.I.T. [82 ITR 363] wherein this Court held that the amount of sales tax paid or payable by the assessee is an expenditure within the meaning of Section 10(ii)(xv) of the Act.

7. We are inclined to think that in a case where a statutory levy in respect of goods dealt in by the assessee is discharged and subsequently the amount paid is refunded, it is the first clause that more appropriately applies. It will not be a case of benefit accruing to him on account of cessation or remission of trading liability. It will be a case which squarely falls under the earlier clause, namely, ""obtained any amount in respect of such expenditure"". In other words, where expenditure is actually incurred by reason of payment of duty on goods and the deduction or allowance had been given in the assessment for earlier period, the assessee is liable to disgorge that benefit as and when the obtains refund of the amount so paid. The consideration whether there is a possibility of the refund being set at naught on a future date will not be a relevant consideration. Once the assessee gets back the amount which was claimed and allowed as business expenditure during the earlier year, the deeming provision in Section 41(1) of the Act comes into play and it is not necessary that the Revenue should await the verdict of higher Court or Tribunal. If the Court or Tribunal upholds the levy at a later date, the assessee will not be without remedy to get back the relief.

8. True, expenditure and trading liability may be over-lapping concepts; but the law-makers apparently intended to deal with allied concepts separately and specifically so as to make the provision as comprehensive as possible in order to effectuate the objective underlying the provision. The anatomy of the Section and the collocation of the words employed therein would suggest that the test of cessation or remission of liability has to be applied vis-a-vis trading liability and it cannot be projected into the previous clause.

9. The typical example of remission or cessation of trading liability is to be found in the recent decision rendered by us in Chief Commissioner of Income Tax v. Kesaria Tea Co. Ltd. MANU/SC/0200/2002MANU/SC/0200/2002 : [2002]254ITR434(SC) . In that case the assessee made a provision in the books of account towards purchase tax liability which was in dispute. Under the impression that the dispute was finally settled with the dismissal of SLP in some other case, the assessee thought it fit to reverse the provision made earlier and accordingly 'wrote back' in its accounts the sums for which the provision was made during earlier years towards purchase tax. It was sought to be taxed by the Income-tax department treating the same as the income of the year during which such reversal of entries which made. However, the Tribunal (with which the High Court agreed) held on facts that the issue regarding the eligibility of purchase tax still remained notwithstanding the holding of the High Court on a part of the controversy relevant to the issue. Even reassessment proceedings were pending. It was, therefore, held that the liability did not cease during the year in question. This Court affirmed the view taken by the High Court of Kerala. It may be seen that unlike the present case, there was no actual refund as no amount towards purchase tax was paid but only a provision towards liability was made in the books of account.

10. Another case which is illustrative of the point is the decision of Allahabad High Court in Rameshwar Prasad v. V.K. Arora [141 ITR 763]. In that case the assessee, who was following the mercantile system of accounting was allowed deduction in respect of its liability towards excise duty. The assessee, however, filed writ petition disputing its liability to pay the duty. During the pendency of the writ petition, the excise duty amount was deposited with the Court. The writ petition was ultimately allowed and the amount deposited by way of security was refunded to the petitioner. However, that decision of the High Court did not become final as the State went in appeal to the Supreme Court. Therefore, the assessee still treated the security deposit amount received from the Court as a possible liability and objected to its inclusion in the taxable income under Section 41(1). The High Court held as follows:

""The excise duty had been deposited by the petitioner in the court itself and that amount was directed to be refunded to it. The amount, therefore, was refunded to the petitioner by the court and not by the State Govt. It is also not correct for the ITO to state that there is no present liability existing against the assessee. It is clear, therefore, that since the assessee followed the mercantile system of accounting, it was allowed deduction in respect of its liability to excise duty. The petitioner challenged its liability to pay the excise duty and during the pendency of the writ petition deposited the excise duty in the court. That payment was not by way of discharge of the liability but was only by way of security and when the writ petition was allowed by the court the amount was refunded to the petitioner. It was not, therefore, a case where an allowance had been made in respect of any expenditure incurred by it or reimbursement of the expenditure subsequently. It was an allowance in respect of a trading liability and in view of the fact that the decision of this court has not become final and is the subject-matter of appeals before the Supreme Court, there has been no remission or cessation of the liability so as to attract Section 41(1) of the Act.""

11. The High Court correctly appreciated the scope of Section 41(1) and applied the second limb of the sub-section to the fact situation. It may be noted that the assessee did neither pay the excise duty to the Government nor did it get refund of duty from the concerned authority. Notwithstanding the High Court's judgment in favour of the petitioner, the stage had not yet reached when it can be said that the liability for which allowance was given earlier ceased. The view taken by the High Court in substance is that the benefit in respect of the trading liability would accrue only when the liability definitely ceased after the termination of the proceedings in the Apex Court in favour of the petitioner. This very decision of the Allahabad High Court was relied upon by the Tribunal without appreciating the correct ratio of the decision.

12. Our attention has been drawn by the learned counsel for the appellant to the case of Union of India v. J.K. Synthetics Ltd. MANU/SC/0360/1994MANU/SC/0360/1994 : [1993]199ITR14(SC) . One of the points urged before the Court was - whether the assessee's liability towards excise duty had ceased justifying action under Section 41(1). This Court, while affirming the view taken by the High Court, observed thus :

""So far as the second question is concerned, it is obvious that the liability to tax under Section 41 of the Act will depend on the outcome of the appeal before this court. It is also stated that as regards another part of the liability, the issue is pending before the Tribunal. It would, therefore, appear that no cessation of liability can be postulated until the Tribunal has decided the matter.""

13. The relevant facts are not mentioned in the judgment. The question whether the latter or earlier clause of Section 41(1) applies did not arise for consideration in that case. The decision of the High Court which was the subject matter of appeal in this Court is reported in J.K. Synthetics Ltd. v. L.T.O. (All.) MANU/WB/0179/1975MANU/WB/0179/1975 : [1976]105ITR684(Cal) . From the facts stated therein it appears that there was no actual payment of duty nor any refund obtained by the assessee. The assessee-company was making provision in the books of account in respect of excise duty payable while disputing the liability to pay duty. Deduction was allowed for various assessment years. The writ petition filed by the assessee-company contesting the demands relating to excise duty was allowed by the High Court. However, the Excise Department preferred Letters Patent Appeal against the order in the writ petition. While so, based on the decision of the High Court in the writ petition, the I.T.O. took steps to disallow the deduction allowed earlier and further disallowed the claim for the current year. Questioning the addition to the income of the relevant previous year, the assessee company filed writ petition which was allowed by the High Court. The facts of the case are quite close to Rameshwar Prasad's case (supra). The following observations in the judgment may be noted as they clearly reveal the fact situation in that case :

""The company, no doubt, is still resisting the claim of the excise authorities, but this fact does not debar the company from claiming deduction on account of the excise duty being demanded from it and for which the company had made provision in its books of accounts. The company is following the mercantile system of accounting and it can legitimately claim deduction in respect of a business liability even if such liability has not been quantified or paid.""

The High Court then held that the liability of the assessee as regards the payment of excise duty cannot be said to have ceased because the judgment of the Single Judge of the High Court did not attain finality.

14. Though, the conclusion of the High Court which was affirmed by this Court cannot be legally faulted, we cannot however approve of the following analysis of the Section occurring in the judgment: ""in short, what this provision means is that if an assessee has been allowed a deduction in the computation of its total income of any liability on account of loss or expenditure and if, subsequently, the liability of the assessee on account of such loss or expenditure is remitted or ceases, that part of the liability which is remitted or ceases shall be treated to be the income of the assessee of the previous year in which such remission or cessation takes place."" The High Court proceeded on the assumption that the words 'remission and cessation thereof' could be transposed into the first clause which speaks of obtaining any amount in respect of loss or expenditure. The High Court could have merely said that the trading liability provided for in the books of account and for which deduction was allowed earlier did not cease in view of the pendency of the dispute. Instead, the High Court referred to the expression ""loss or expenditure"" occurring in the first limb. As the assessee company did not obtain any amount by way of refund one excise duty account, the first clause of Section 41(1) will not be applicable' it is only the latter part that applies in which case the remission or cessation of liability would assume importance. However, in the present case, as discussed above, it is the first clause that squarely applies but not the second one. Whether there was cessation or remission of liability would be an irrelevant line of enquiry here. The correct way of understanding Section 41(1) would be to read the latter clause - ""some benefit in respect of such trading liability by way of remission or cessation thereof' as a distinct and self-contained provision. To read the phrase ""by way of remission or cessation thereof"" as governing the previous clause as well, i.e. ""obtained any amount in respect of such loss or expenditure"", would be doing violence to the language and structure of the provision. That apart, the operation of the provision which is designed to have widest amplitude will get constricted and truncated by reason of such interpretation.

15. Learned counsel for the appellant has also relied on a decision of the Gujarat High Court in V.T. Audyogik Sahakari Mandli Ltd. v. C.I.T. MANU/GJ/0058/1999MANU/GJ/0058/1999 : [2000]242ITR627(Guj) . That decision prima facie supports the appellant. The learned Judges proceeded on the basis that in all situations falling under Section 41(1) the test whether there was remission or cessation of trading liability has to be applied, and therefore, concluded that even if the amount of refund is received, Section 41(1) cannot be invoked so long as there is no final decision on the question of legality of levy. To reach such a conclusion, the decision in J.K. Synthetics's case (supra) and Rameshwar Prasad's case (supra) were relied upon. We have already explained the ratio of those decisions. Another case on which strong reliance was placed by the learned Judges is the judgment of the Full Bench in C.I.T. v. Bharat Iron & Steel Industries MANU/GJ/0032/1992MANU/GJ/0032/1992 : [1993]199ITR67(Guj) . In the said Full Bench decision, though the discussion by and large proceeded on right lines, we find that the actual decision reached in the concluding para is based on a wrong interpretation of the provision. The Full Bench was of the view that the assessee's claim for refund of excise duty was in jeopardy in view of the pending revisional proceeding although the assessee obtained refund. The assessee received the refund of excise duty on 8.8.1975. The High Court took the view that the assessee obtained the refund only on 30.4.1976 when the proposed revision was withdrawn. It was therefore held that the refunded amount became includible in the assessee's total income for the assessment year 1976-1977 under Section 41(1) of the Act, but not for the assessment year 1974-1975. The expression 'obtained any amount' was virtually given an interpretation which is contrary to its plain meaning. However, it must be noted that the High Court rightly avoided reference to the expression 'remission or cessation thereof'.

16. With respect, we are unable to accept the view taken by Gujarat High Court in the two decisions afore-mentioned as correct.

17. The decision of Karnataka High Court in K.G. Subramanyam v. C.I.T. MANU/KA/0236/1991MANU/KA/0236/1991 : [1992]195ITR199(KAR) is quite apposite in the context of present case. The State of Karnataka levied 'litre fee' which is in the nature of a duty of excise. The levy was challenged by the assessee. Pending such challenge, the assessee paid the litre fee which was allowed as deduction while computing the assessee's income. Later on the levy of litre fee was declared as unconstitutional and the fee collected was refunded to the assessee. Relying on Section 41(1), the refunded amount was subjected to tax treating it as income of the year during which refund was obtained. The Tribunal and the High Court held that Section 41(1) was attracted and the Revenue was well justified in assessing the same. The High Court held that the payment in discharge of statutory liability incurred while earning the income is an expenditure and even if it is possible in some cases that such payment is liable to be excluded from the income as a liability incurred in the course of trade, it does not detract from its character as expenditure. It was, therefore, held: ""We have no hesitation that the deduction given to the assessee in respect of the litre fee paid by him was by way of an expenditure; therefore, the amounts refunded or the levy being held unconstitutional were the amounts received by him in respect of the said expenditure and such receipts are liable to be taxed under Section 41(1)."" The High Court observed that on the facts of that case, the question of cessation or remission of liability did not arise for consideration at all. We are in agreement with the view expressed by the Karnataka High Court.

18. In the light of the above discussion we find no merit in the appeal though we must say that the order under appeal is cryptic and the short reasoning recorded therein is inaccurate. The appeal is dismissed without costs.

GENESIS OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION:

7. One Shri C.K. Rajan addressed a letter dated 3.2.1993 to one of the Hon'ble Judges of the High Court of Kerala and thereby bringing to his notice purported serious irregularities, corrupt practices, mal-administration and mismanagement prevailing in the temple. He was called by the High Court and its Registrar recorded his statement on 11.2.1993. The said letter was treated as an original petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The High Court in its order dated 12.2.1993 highlighted 23 aspects of the matter which had been brought to its notice and appointed one Shri S. Krishnan Unni, District Judge Officiating as the Director of Training, High Court of Kerala as the Commissioner to make a general enquiry and in particular make a study on the various aspects highlighted in the said complaint. The Commissioner pursuant to the order of the High Court seized all the records of the temple, examined 85 witnesses and submitted as many as 15 interim reports on 15.2.1393, 10.3.1993, 30.3.1993, 3.4.1933, 16.4.1993, 12.5.1993, 9.6.1993, 26.6.1993, 20.7.1993, 21.7.1993, 4.8.1993, 11.8.1933, 13.8.1993, 2.9.1993, 2.9.1993. It submitted its final report on 25.9.1993.

8. An order passed by the High Court on 12.2.1993 was the subject matter of a Special Leave Petition before this Court being SLP (Civil).../93 CC 20040 wherein this Court suggested in its order dated 26.3.1993 the following guidelines for consideration of the Court:

""(i) It is not disputed that the management of the Guruvayur temple is governed by the Guruvayur Devaswom Act, 1978. There may be other State legislations governing the functioning of religious institution in the State. The High Court shall take into consideration the relevant provisions of these enactments.

(ii) The Guruvayur Devaswom Managing Committee and the State of Kerala are necessary parties in this public interest litigation. The High Court shall take into consideration the objections including of preliminary nature raised/ to be raised by these parties.

(iii) The appointment, tenure of office and other conditions of service of the Administrator and other Officers connected with the Guruvayur, as are provided by law, shall be kept in view while passing any orders concerning these officers.

The High Court is requested to conclude the proceedings expeditiously and if possible, within six months from today.""

9. Another Special Leave Petition was filed praying for an order restraining the Enquiry Commissioner from submitting his final report being SLP (Civil) NO. 3231/93 but the same was dismissed vide this Court's order dated 10.5.1993 observing:

""Learned counsel for the petitioner urged and vehemently pleaded for restraining the enquiry Commissioner from submitting his final report as in that case the High Court may not decide the preliminary objection raised on their behalf that there being a detailed procedure provided in the Statute, the High Court should not have exercised its extraordinary jurisdiction. We do not find any justification for such apprehension.

In the result, this petition fails and is dismissed. ""

10. Pursuant to or in furtherance of the observations made by this Court, an application was filed for determining the maintainability of the matter as a preliminary issue. However, in the meantime, the Commissioner had submitted 10 interims reports, examined a number of persons and a large number of persons were also impleaded as parties in the writ petition.

11. Mr. V.R. Reddy appearing for the State of Kerala allegedly conceded that the plea regarding want of jurisdiction raised did not merit consideration at that stage and the same had become infructuous.

12. The Bench noticed that the reports contained various observations and recommendations as regard the interim reports. Some statements were filed in respect of some of the reports by some of the respondents only. Correctness or otherwise of various reports and suggestions made therein were, however, not questioned.

13. The third respondent had filed the following statements to the following interim reports:

14. The first respondent - State of Kerala had filed the following statements in relation to the following interim reports :

""1. statement filed by the Commissioner and Secretary (Finance) dated 15.10.1993

2. Statement filed by the Government Pleader dated 2.12.1993

3. Preliminary objections dated 29.5.1993""

15. As noticed hereinbefore, the Commissioner filed his final report, on 25.9.1993.

16. The State of Kerala prayed for time for filing objections to the Commissioner's final report and was granted time thrice but it ultimately failed to respond thereto.

17. No affidavit by way of an objection to the said reports was filed by any party. During hearing of the matter, the Chairman, The Guruvayur Devaswom Managing Committee (for short 'the Committee'), and the State agreed with many of the recommendations made by the Commissioner. Appellant herein also substantially agreed with various recommendations of the Commissioner.

18. The Court specifically asked for objections to the recommendations of the Commissioner. The fifth respondent - M.P. Gopalakrishnan and the third respondent - Chairman of the Committee filed objections but at the argument stage only a few of the matters stated in the statements were highlighted or pressed.

19. Upon considerations of the various matters the High Court in its impugned judgment arrived at its findings on the recommendations of the Commission, the summary whereof has been stated in para 64 thereof.

20. The High Court lamented:

""The temple and the idol of Guruvayur is the very Brahman itself, so easily obtained, which can, in the ordinary course, be obtained only after undergoing all trials and tribulations. That is the greatness of this Lord of Guruvayur (Sree Krishna), the temple sought by millions all over and about which every Hindu holds a candle, but alas! Its administration has sunk to low levels, to be ashamed of; we hope and pray that this litigation will give a turning point for the improvement and better administration of the Devaswom.""

SUBMISSIONS:

21. Mr. K.K. Venugopal and Mr. V.R. Reddy, the learned senior counsels appearing on behalf of the appellant and the State of Kerala respectively, at the outset invited our attention to the orders of this Court dated 26.3.1993 passed in SLP (C) No..../93 CC 20040, and orders dated 26.4.1993 as well as 10.5.1993 passed in SLP (C) No. 3231/93 and submitted that keeping in view of the fact that this Court was approached at least on three different occasions wherein the jurisdiction of the Court to initiate a public interest litigation was questioned, the High Court committed a manifest error in not deciding the same as a preliminary issue.

22. The learned counsels further drew our attention to the order passed in CMP No. 10669 of 1993 requesting the High Court to consider the maintainability as a preliminary issue. It was submitted that a wrong statement has further been recorded in the said order to the effect that the Managing Committee has unanimously resolved welcoming the enquiry and they would not take steps assailing the same.

23. The High Court was further wrongly opined that the said CMP has become infructuous having regard to the fact that 10 interim reports have been submitted by the Enquiry Commissioner and the work of the Commissioner was practically nearing completion.

24. Mr. Venugopal would urge that the High Court misdirected itself in not only entertaining the letter of the Fifth Respondent as a public interest litigation but also by appointing a commissioner and directing seizure of all the documents resulting in serious adverse publicity against the appellant-committee, purported to be relying on or on the basis of the statement of Respondent No. 1 that some of the allegations made by him would be borne out from the records maintained by the temple.

25. Drawing our attention to the provisions of Commission of Enquiry Act, 1952 and the Kerala Public Men's Corruption (Investigations and Inquiries) Act, 1987 (Act 24 of 1988), the learned counsel would submit that for all intent and purport the High Court exercised its jurisdiction in terms thereof and, thus, assumed a jurisdiction which it did not have. A full-fledged enquiry akin to the provisions of the 1952 Act and Kerala Public Men's Corruption (Investigations and Inquiries) Act, 1987 is unknown in a public interest litigation and in this behalf our attention has been drawn to the appointment of amicus as also the appointment of lawyers for the Commissioner.

26. The learned counsel, in particular, drew our attention to the order dated 17th February, 1993 passed in O.P. No. 2071 of 1993 and submitted that a perusal thereof would show that the High Court even directed the Director of Public Relations for wide publication of these matters and invited complaints and suggestions from the public in general.

27. By reason of the said order, the High Court also appointed M/s. Menon & Menon, Chartered Accountants, Ernakulam as auditors. The Enquiry Commissioner was given accommodation at the High Court as also at Guruvayur. The Registrar of the High Court was directed to depute appropriate and necessary staff to the Enquiry Commissioner, Even a police officer was appointed to assist the Enquiry Commissioner in the field work.

28. The High Court also, the learned counsel would submit, must be held to have committed a manifest error in taking over the administration of the temple for an intent and purport: even by going to the extent of directing that the Administrator would not be transferred.

29. Mr. Venugopal would urge that the said Act contains provisions for effective management of the temple and the purported assumption of jurisdiction by the High Court must be held to be bad in law. Further contention of the learned counsel was that the Commissioner examined 85 witnesses but their names and particulars, although asked for, were not supplied nor were they allowed to be cross-examined. It was pointed out that the names of the witnesses and the documents which were marked as Exhibits were indicated only in the Final Report and despite the fact that no opportunity was given to the affected parties to cross-examine the witnesses, strictures were passed against them relying on or on the basis of their unworn testimony.

30. The learned counsel would urge that the High Court acted illegally and without jurisdiction in passing the impugned directions purported to be acting as a parens patriae inasmuch as the statutory acts governed the field. There is no reason, the learned counsel would contend, to by-pass the provisions of the Act as also the Code of civil Procedure.

31. The learned counsel would argue that a roving enquiry is not contemplated in a public interest litigation.

32. Mr. Venugopal would further submit that when the management of a temple is governed by a statutory enactment wherein power has been conferred upon the Government to look into the grievances and pass an appropriate orders thereupon, the High Court must be held to have exceeded its jurisdiction in issuing the impugned directions inasmuch as before embarking thereupon it was obligatory on its part to ask the Government to remedy the defects. It is not a case, the learned counsel would contend, where the complainant belonged to a weaker section or was not in a position to take recourse of the said Act or initiate a proceeding in terms of Section 92 of the Code of civil Procedure. Mr. Venugopal would contend that indisputably the High Court has inherent powers but such inherent powers cannot be exercised in defiance of law. Once such a power is exercised by an organ of the State, the same would be against the rule of law.

33. Mr. Reddy appearing on behalf of the State of Kerala drew our attention to the affidavit filed by the State and submitted that the High Court misunderstood his submissions to the effect that he had not pressed the High Court to decide the maintainability of the petitioner as a preliminary issue. According to the learned counsel, as by the time the order of this Court dated 12.2.1933 was communicated; 10 interim reports had been submitted, a submission was made only to the effect that the merit of those reports may be directed to be considered by the State. The learned counsel would contend that the very fact that the parties agitated the question of jurisdiction second time before this Court is a clear pointer to show that the question as regards jurisdiction of the High Court to entertain such application was not given up.

34. Mr. Subba Rao, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent No. 5, on the other hand, would, submit that there are precedents wherein enquiries were directed to be made through a Commission for finding out the correctness or otherwise of the allegations made in a writ petition. It was submitted that even provisions of the Commission of Enquiry Act was resorted to for the purpose of enquiry as regard management of temples. Reference in this connection has been made on Tilkayat Shri Govindlalji Maharaj v. The State of Rajasthan and Ors. MANU/SC/0028/1963MANU/SC/0028/1963 : [1964]1SCR561 and Sri Sri Sri Lakshmana Yatendrule and Ors. v. State of A.P. and Ors. MANU/SC/0368/1996MANU/SC/0368/1996 : [1996]1SCR929 .

35. Mr. Subba Rao would argue that devotees who are mostly conservatives would expect that the management of the temple is carried out strictly in terms of the heritage and tradition of the temple and tenets and practices relating to offering of puja and matters ancillary thereto and connected therewith should scrupulously be followed. Any deviation or departure from the established practices and tenets would hurt the sentiments of the devotees and as such they would be entitled to bring the same to the notice of the High Court which is conferred with the jurisdiction to investigate into the matter not only in exercise of its power under Article 226 of the Constitution but also in terms of various statutes as also under the Code of civil Procedure, 1908. Referring to the decision of this Court in Bandhua Mukthi Morcha v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0051/1983MANU/SC/0051/1983 : [1984]2SCR67 , Mr. Subba Rao would submit that there in this Court has laid down the procedure for making enquiry into the allegations or causing the same to be made for the purpose of gathering necessary facts so as to grant appropriate reliefs, to the needy and poor. Mr. Subba Rao would urge that the High court has merely followed the procedure laid down by this Court in Bandhua Mukti Morcha (supra) and, thus, the question of giving an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses or their particulars be disclosed does not arise. Only when a report is submitted, the concerned parties were entitled to file affidavits there against. But in this case, even no such affidavit has been filed.

36. Mr. Subba Rao has drawn our pointed attention to the following orders:

(i) Order dated 25.8.1993 of the High Court in C.M.P. No. 10669 of 1993 filed by Guruvayur Devasom Managing Committee;

(ii) Judgment dated 10.1.1994

(iii) Order dated 25th August, 1993 in C.M.P. No. 10699/93 in O.P. No. 2071 of 1993.

37. The learned counsel would submit, in view of the aforesaid it does not lie in the mouth of any of the learned counsels to contend that the High Court had no jurisdiction to initiate the proceedings. Reliance in this connection has also been placed on State of Maharashtra v. Ramdas Shrinivas Nayak and Anr., MANU/SC/0117/1982MANU/SC/0117/1982 : 1982CriLJ1581 .

38. Mr. Subba Rao would further urge that only because a floodgate of litigation would be opened if a public interest litigation is entertained, the same itself cannot be a ground for holding that public interest litigation should be entertained. Our attention in this connection has been drawn on Woolwich Building Society v. Inland Revenue Commissioners (No. 2) (1992) 3 All ER 737 and Johnson v. Unisys Ltd. (2001) 2 All ER 801.

39. Mr. Subba Rao would urge that the High Court is a parens patriae in relation to the devotees is neither in doubt nor in dispute. Reliance in this behalf has been placed on State of Kerala and Anr. v. N.M. Thomas and Ors. MANU/SC/0479/1975MANU/SC/0479/1975 : (1976)ILLJ376SC and Charan Lal Sahu etc. etc. v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0159/1987MANU/SC/0159/1987 : 1988CriLJ181 .

40. Power of the High Court and this Court under Articles 226 and 32 of the Constitution of India remain untrammeled despite existence of statutory provisions controlling the power of executive and, thus, it was argued that the High Court and this Court cannot be stripped of its constitutional powers to look into the omissions and commissions on the part of the administrators of the temple. A proceeding initiated as a public interest litigation would lie before the High Court or this Court, according to Mr. Subba Rao, when it is found that despite existence of statutory provisions the State or the other statutory functionaries were not taking recourse to the provisions thereof for remedying the grievances of the devotees. In any event, as a Hindu temple is a juristic person the very fact that Section 92 of the Code of civil Procedure seeks to protect the same, for the self-same purpose Articles 226 and 32 could also be taken recourse to. Our attention in this behalf has been drawn on Yogendra Nath Naskar v. Commissioner of Income-Tax, Calcutta and Manohar Ganesh Tambekar v. Lakhmiram Govindram MANU/MH/0045/1887MANU/MH/0045/1887.

SCOPE OF PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION:

41. The Courts exercising their power of judicial review found to its dismay that the poorest of the poor, depraved, the illiterate, the urban and rural unorganized labour sector, women, children, handicapped by 'ignorance, indigence and illiteracy' and other down trodden have either no access to justice or had been denied justice. A new branch of proceedings known as 'Social Interest Litigation' or 'Public Interest Litigation' was evolved with a view to render complete justice to the aforementioned classes of persona. It expanded its wings in course of time. The Courts in pro bono publico granted relief to the inmates of the prisons, provided legal aid, directed speedy trial, maintenance of human dignity and covered several other areas. Representative actions, pro bono publico and test litigations were entertained in keeping with the current accent on justice to the common man and a necessary disincentive to those who wish to by pass the, real issues on the merits by suspect reliance on peripheral procedural shortcomings. (See Mumbai Kamgar Sabha, Bombay v. Abdulbhai Faizullabhai and Ors. MANU/SC/0313/1976MANU/SC/0313/1976 : (1976)IILLJ186SC ).

42. The Court in pro bono publico proceedings intervened when there had been callous neglect as a policy of State, a lack of probity in public life, abuse of power in control and destruction of environment. It also protected the inmates of persons and homes. It sought to restrain exploitation of labour practices.

43. The court expanded the meaning of life and liberty as envisaged in Article 21 of the Constitution of India. It jealously enforced Article 23 of the Constitution. Statutes were interpreted with human rights angle in view. Statutes were interpreted in the light of international treatises, protocols and conventions. Justice was made available having regard to the concept of human right even, in cases where the State was not otherwise apparently liable. (See Kapila Hingorani v. State of Bihar reported in MANU/SC/0403/2003MANU/SC/0403/2003 : (2003)IIILLJ31SC ).

44. The people of India have turned to courts more and more for Justice whenever there had been a legitimate grievance against the State's statutory authorities and other public organizations. People come to courts as the final resort, to protect their rights and to secure probity in public life.

45. Pro bono publico constituted a significant state in the present day judicial system. They, however, provided the dockets with much greater responsibility for rendering the concept of justice available to the disadvantaged sections of the society. Public interest litigation has come to stay and its necessity cannot be overemphasized. The courts evolved a jurisprudence of compassion. Procedural propriety was to move over giving place to substantive concerns of the deprivation of rights. The rule of locus standi was diluted. The Court in place of disinterested and dispassionate adjudicator became active participant in the dispensation of justice.

46. But with the passage of time, things started taking different shapes. The process was sometimes abused. Proceedings were initiated in the name of public Interest litigation for ventilating private disputes. Some petitions were publicity oriented.

47. A balance was, therefore, required to be struck. The Courts started exercising greater care and caution in the matter of exercise of jurisdiction of public interest litigation.

48. The Court insisted on furnishing of security before granting injunction and imposing very heavy costs when a petition was found to be bogus. It took strict action when it was found that the motive to file a public interest litigation was oblique.

49. The decisions rendered by this Court in different types of public interest litigations are varied.

50. The principles evolved by this Court in this behalf may be suitably summarized as under :

(i) The Court in exercise"

A.K. Sikri and Rohinton Fali Nariman, JJ.

1. Leave granted. We have heard the matter finally with the consent of the learned Counsel appearing for the parties.

2. The short question which is involved in this Appeal is as to whether the Debt Recovery Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as 'DRT') has power to condone the delay in filing the Appeal.

3. The Appellants have filed the Appeal against the Order of the Recovery Officer before the DRT Under Section 30 of the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (hereinafter referred to as 'Act' for short). There is a limitation period of 30 days provided for filing such an Appeal. However, there was a delay of 15 days in filing the Appeal, which was condoned by the DRT. This Order was challenged before the High Court and the High Court has set aside the Order of the DRT on the ground that Limitation Act, 1963, does not apply to the proceedings before the DRT. This question of the High Court is contrary to the specific provisions contained in Sections 20 & 24 of the Act which reads as under:

""20. Appeal to the Appellate Tribunal.-

(1) Save as provided in Sub-section (2), any person aggrieved by an Order made, or deemed to have been made, by a Tribunal under this Act, may prefer an Appeal to an Appellate Tribunal having jurisdiction in the matter.

(2) No Appeal shall lie to the Appellate Tribunal from an Order made by a Tribunal with the consent of the parties.

(3) Every Appeal Under Sub-section (1) shall be filed within a period of forty-five days from the date on which a copy of the Order made, or deemed to have been made, by the Tribunal is received by him and it shall be in such form and be accompanied by such fee as may be prescribed:

Provided that the Appellate Tribunal may entertain an Appeal after the expiry of the said period of forty-five days if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within that period.

(4) On receipt of an Appeal Under Sub-section (1), the Appellate Tribunal may, after giving the parties to the Appeal, an opportunity of being heard, pass such orders thereon as it thinks fit, confirming, modifying or setting aside the order appealed against.

(5) The Appellate Tribunal shall send a copy of every Order made by it to the parties to the Appeal and to the concerned Tribunal.

(6) The Appeal filed before the Appellate Tribunal Under Sub-section (1) shall be dealt with by it as expeditiously as possible and endeavour shall be made by it to dispose of the Appeal finally within six months from the date of receipt of the Appeal.""

""24. Limitation.--The provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963), shall, as far as may be, apply to an Application made to a Tribunal.""

4. It is clear form the aforesaid Section 24 that specific power is given to the DRT to condone the delay. Therefore, the High Court Order is clearly unsustainable and is set aside. The Appeal is remitted back to the DRT for deciding on merits. Having regard to the nature of the dispute involved, we direct the DRT to decide the Appeal preferred against the Order of the Recovery Officer within a period of 3 months from the date of receipt of the copy of this Order. The Appeal stands disposed of accordingly.

S.N. Variava, J.

1. This appeal is against the judgment dated 7th February, 2000.

2. Briefly stated the facts are as follows:

The Appellant appeared for M.A. Examination in Islamic History and Culture held by the Calcutta University in November, 1984. The result of the examination was announced on 6th June, 1985. However the result of the Appellant was not declared. The Appellant then took admission in the Law Course. On 9th December, 1990, the Appellant wrote to the Controller of Examinations and requested that his result, of the examination held in 1984, be declared. He also wrote to the Vice Chancellor on 14th February, 1991 and made the same request. He then filed a Writ Petition in the High Court of Calcutta for issuance of Writ in the nature of Mandamus commanding publication of his result. On 12th July, 1991, the result of the Appellant was declared and he was found to have failed. The Appellant has not challenged the result of the examination and has accepted the fact that he has failed.

3. With the declaration of the result nothing really survived in the Writ Petition. However the learned Single Judge of the High Court appointed a Committee presided over by a retired High Court Judge to investigate why the result had not been declared for so many years. The Committee gave the following findings:

""1) The candidate knew that he was unsuccessful soon after the publication of the result.

2) In the absence of relevant papers it cannot be said that the Examiner put different marks on the 2 slips of the Tabulators.

3)(a) The scrutinizer failed in his duty in not detecting the discrepancy and yet putting his signature signifying that the marks on the Tabulation sheets were correct.

(b) His conduct in not appearing before the Enquiry Committee does not speak well.

4) The Tabulators did not notice the discrepancy and even if they had noticed, they did not point out the same to the authority. They were under obligation to do so.

5) The dealing Assistant ought to have been more vigilant in pursuing this matter. 6) The Section-in-Charge of the Result Section ought to have made enquiry about incomplete result. The Section-in- Charge of the Result Section or for the matter of that any officer in the Controller's department must have to see that a result does not remain incomplete for long years.

7) The Controller should find out ways and means and should take such steps so that in future result does not remain incomplete for years as in the present case.

8) I do not find any conspiracy between the candidate and any staff of the University.""

4. The learned Single Judge thereafter held that the University of Calcutta and the Vice Chancellor should pay to the Appellant a sum of Rs. 60,000/- as monetary compensation and damages before 31st January, 1992. The learned Single Judge also directed the Vice Chancellor to take appropriate steps against the scrutinizer, tabulators, dealing assistant and Sequin-in-Charge and above all the Controller of Examination for defaulting in discharging their duties. The learned Single Judge also directed payment of cost fixed at Rs. 200 G.Ms.

5. The Respondents filed an appeal. The Division Bench by the impugned judgment dated 7th February, 2000 agreed with the findings of the Single Judge that the Respondents had been negligent. It was also noted that the Appellant had known that he had failed in the Examination and had not sought for issuance of the mark sheet for the long time. It was noted that the Appellant had not waited for his result but had pursued studies in the Law Course. It was held that it was not established by the Appellant as to what problems he had faced and to what extent he had suffered prejudice. It was held that this was not a fit case where the doctrine of public law should have been invoked. It was held that normally damages, under this doctrine, are awarded in the following cases:

""(a) to the petitioners who suffered personal injuries at the hands of the Government and the causing of injuries which amounted to tortuous act;

(b) cases relating to custodial deaths; and

(c) cases where medical negligence has been proved. However, in Manju Bhatia & Anr. vs. New Delhi Municipal Council & Anr. reported in 1997 (2) SCC 370, the Apex Court in a case where a building which was constructed in violation of law was demolished after the flats were sold. Only in exceptional cases damages had been granted for tortuous liability.""

6. It was held that on the facts of this case compensation should not have been awarded to the Appellant but the proper course would have been to leave the parties to agitate their grievances before a competent Civil Court. By the impugned judgment the award of damages in the sum of Rs. 60,000/- was set aside but the award of cost in favour of the Appellant was maintained.

7. Mr. Jaideep Gupta submitted that the Division Bench erred in concluding that this was not a fit case where damages should have been awarded in public law domain. He relied upon the authority in the case of Lucknow Development Authority vs. M.K. Gupta reported in MANU/SC/0178/1994MANU/SC/0178/1994 : AIR1994SC787 . This was the case where the Lucknow Development Authority had floated a scheme of construction of houses or flats. The Respondent therein had been allotted a flat under that scheme. The Respondent had made the entire payment for the flat. It was found that there was use of sub-standard material and delay in delivery of the flat. The question before the Court was whether a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 was maintainable. This Court held that such a complaint was maintainable. It was also held that the society or the tax payer must have a remedy for oppressive and capricious acts of public officers. It was held that the administrative law of accountability of public authorities for their arbitrary and even ultra vires actions has taken so many strides. It was held that it has now been accepted by this Court that the State was liable to compensate for loss or injury suffered by a citizen due to arbitrary action of its employees. It was held that jurisdictional power of Court to indemnify for the injury suffered due to abuse of power by a public authority was founded on the principle that an award of exemplary damage can serve a useful purpose in vindicating the strength of law. It was held that such a power acts as a check on arbitrary and capricious exercise of power. It was held that the award of compensation for harassment by the public authority not only compensates the individual, satisfies him personally but helps in curing a social evil. It was held that it may result in improving the work culture and help in changing the outlook. It was held that this development of law apart, from other factors, succeeds in keeping a salutary check on the functioning in the Government and semi-government offices by holding the officers personally responsible for their capricious or even ultra vires action resulting in injury or loss to a citizen by awarding damages against them.

8. Reliance was also placed on the case of Common Cause versus Union of India and others reported in MANU/SC/0437/1999MANU/SC/0437/1999 : [1999]3SCR1279 : [1999]3SCR1279 , wherein after considering a catena of decisions it has been held that this Court and the High Courts being the protectors of the civil liberties of the citizen have the power and jurisdiction and also an obligation to grant relief in exercise of jurisdiction under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution to victims or the heir of the victim whose fundamental rights under Article 21 of the Constitution have been infringed. It was held that this can be done by calling upon the State to repair the damage done by its officers to the fundamental rights of the citizen notwithstanding the right of the citizen to a remedy by way of a civil suit or criminal proceedings. It was held that such relief can be granted only when it is established that there has been infringement of the fundamental right of the citizen.

9. There can be no dispute with the proposition of law. A claim in public law for compensation for contravention of human rights and fundamental freedoms, the protection of which is guaranteed in the Constitution is undoubtedly an acknowledged remedy for protection and enforcement of such right and such a claim based on strict liability made by resorting to a constitutional remedy, provided for the enforcement of fundamental right is distinct from, and in addition to the remedy in private law for damages for the tort, as was held by this Court in Nilabati Behera. It is in fact an innovation of a new tool with the Court which are the protectors of the civil liberty of the citizens and the Court, in exercise of the same, would be in a position to grant compensation when it comes to the conclusion that there has been a violation of fundamental rights under Article 21. It is in this context, this Court has observed:

""That the citizen complaining of the infringement of an indefeasible right under Article 21 of the Constitution cannot be told that for the established violation of the fundamental right to life he cannot get any relief under the public law by the Courts exercising writ jurisdiction.""

10. The Courts having the obligation to satisfy the social aspiration of the citizens have to apply the tool and grant compensation as damages in a public law proceedings. Consequently when the Court moulds the relief in proceedings under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution seeking enforcement or protection of fundamental rights and grants compensation, it does so under the public law by way of penalising the wrongdoer and fixing the liability for the public wrong on the State which has failed in its public duty to protect the fundamental rights of the citizens. But it would not be correct to assume that every minor infraction of public duty by every public officer would commend the Court to grant compensation in a petition under Articles 226 and 32 by applying the principle of public law proceeding. The Court in exercise of extraordinary power under Articles 226 and 32 of the Constitution, therefore, would not award damages against public authorities merely because they have made some order which turns out to be ultra vires, or there has been some inaction in the performance of the duties unless there is malice or conscious abuse. Before exemplary damages can be awarded it must be shown that some fundamental right under Article 21 has been infringed by arbitrary or capricious action on the part of the public functionaries and that the sufferer was a helpless victim of that act.

11. As set out above the report of the Committee clearly shows that the Appellant was aware, from the beginning, that he had failed. He did nothing for a number of years to have his result declared. The High Court is right when it holds that in this case it has not been shown what problem the Appellant faced and to what extent he has suffered prejudice. It is not shown how the Appellants future was affected by the results not being declared. This is not a case where because of non-disclosure of the results, the Appellant was prevented from undertaking future studies. In fact the Appellant took up law course. In our view the Division Bench was right in concluding that even though the Respondents were negligent in not declaring the result, this was not a fit case where compensation could or should have been awarded.

We are also in agreement with the Division Bench that a case for compensation had not even been pleaded or proved.

12. We, therefore, see no infirmity in the impugned judgment. We see no reason to interfere with the judgment of the High Court. The appeal stands dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.

1. Leave granted.

2. The Appellant herein, in these appeals, challenges the validity of the judgment dated 18.07.2014 passed by High Court of Judicature at Gujarat cancelling the anticipatory bail which was granted to the Appellant by the Additional Sessions Judge, Court No. 16 of Ahmedabad City Sessions Court.

3. Before coming to the factual narrative of a long drawn event that has taken place in respect of criminal trial pending against the Appellant, we would like to state, in capsiculated manner, the circumstances under which the matter has landed up in this Court. The Appellant and Respondent No. 2 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Prosecutrix') were neighbours at the relevant time and known to each other. On 29.05.2001, the prosecutrix wrote a complaint to the Assistant Police Commissioner, Crime Branch, Gaekwad Haveli, Ahmedabad City alleging the harassment that was meted out to her by the Appellant over a period of time. Allegations of rape, emotional blackmail and threats were levelled against the Appellant therein. After two days i.e. on 31.05.2001, her statement was recorded by a Police officer of the concerned Police Station wherein she again levelled the allegations of maltreatment, blackmail etc. However, in this statement of hers, which was recorded by the Investigating Officer (I.O.), allegations of rape were conspiciously missing. On the basis of statement made on 31.05.2001, F.I.R. was registered and charge Under Section 506(2) of Indian Penal Code (Indian Penal Code) was framed in the year 2001. The Appellant was admitted to bail in the said case. Trial has proceeded which has not made much headway for number of years. In the year 2010, the prosecutrix made an application for addition of charge Under Section 376 Indian Penal Code as well. The Metropolitan Magistrate held that the said application should be taken into consideration only after chief examination of the complainant. The prosecutrix challenged the said order before the Court of City Session Judge at Ahmedabad. The matter was remanded back to the Metropolitan Magistrate with a direction that the application shall be heard afresh in its entirety after giving opportunity to both parties. On 31.03.2012, the Metropolitan Magistrate directed the Police to carry out special investigation Under Section 173(8) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as the 'Code'). Being not satisfied, the parties challenged the above order. The matter travelled up to this Court wherein certain directions were issued. Ultimately, the Police filed a revised chargesheet stating that a prima facie case Under Section 376 Indian Penal Code was also made out. In view of addition of charge Under Section 376 Indian Penal Code, the Magistrate passed the order on 25.04.2013 for committal of proceedings to the Sessions Court and taking the Appellant into custody. However, execution of this order for taking the Appellant into custody was stayed till 07.05.2013. During this period, the Appellant moved the City Sessions Court No. 16 at Ahmedabad for grant of anticipatory bail which was ultimately granted on 18.05.2013. Against this order of grant of anticipatory bail, the prosecutrix filed criminal revision petition which has been allowed by the High Court vide impugned order dated 18.07.2014 cancelling the anticipatory bail granted to the Appellant. As pointed out above, it is the justification and legality of this order which is in question before us in the instant appeals.

4. The aforesaid brief resume depicts that the charge was framed against the Appellant initially in the year 2001 only Under Section 506(2) of Indian Penal Code. Insofar as charge Under Section 376 of Indian Penal Code is concerned, it is added only in the year 2014. Further, the original charge was framed Under Section 506(2) Indian Penal Code on the basis of the statement recorded on 31.05.2001 which was treated as FIR and which did not contain the allegation of rape. If one has to go by these facts, coupled with the fact that allegation of rape is of the year 1997-98, one may not find fault with the order of the Additional Session Judge granting anticipatory bail. However, the impugned order passed by the High Court whereby the anticipatory bail order of the Additional Session Judge is cancelled, does not take the matter in such a simplistic manner and, therefore, a detailed discussion on the issue has become imperative.

5. The High Court took note of the circumstances which led to the addition of charge Under Section 376 Indian Penal Code at a belated stage. Thus, it would be necessary to take stock of those detailed events and thereafter decide as to whether the order of the High Court is sustainable or not. These facts are recapitulated with elaboration which is absolutely necessary for our purposes, as under:

6. As mentioned above, before registration of the FIR on 31.05.2001 on the basis of the statement, the prosecutrix had filed a complaint on 29.05.2001 before the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Crime Branch. In this complaint, she stated that she is a housewife and had been residing at 1, Navpad Tenement, Opposite Nava Vikas Gruh, Behind Opera for 1 1/2 years. She further mentioned that prior to shifting to this place, she was residing with her in-laws at Sanand for 10 years. She was married, with three children, and her husband was a Jeweller. She alleged in the complaint that about 2 1/2 years prior thereto, she had gone to C.N. Vidhyalaya where her daughter Devel was studying. To return home, she was to catch a Bus. When she was standing at the Bus Stand, the Appellant, who was her neighbour, passed through that place in his car and on seeing the prosecutrix, he asked her to sit in the car as he was also going home. Though, she initially refused but thereafter she sat in the car being unaware of his malafide intentions. Thereafter, he took the car to some uninhabited place near Telav Village, beat her and forcefully raped her. He also threatened her not to narrate the above incident to anybody. Being scared of these threats, she did not tell the incident to anybody. Taking benefit of the circumstances, after one month he repeated the act of rape by giving the threat that if the prosecutrix did not agree, he would tell her husband and others. He took her to Hotel Ellis Town and raped her against her wishes. After that, he threatened her of dire consequences saying that he had taken her photographs. This way he continued to keep relations with the prosecutrix. This complaint further states that she shifted to Ahmedabad but even after coming to Ahmedabad, he started sending letters with the threat to defame her. At that stage, she told her husband and in-laws. She went to Jyoti Sangh, a NGO and encouraged by their support, she lodged the complaint of continuous harassment on the part of the Appellant.

7. On 31.05.2001, her statement was recorded in the Police Station by the IO in which the allegations of misbehaviour by the Appellant are contained and the entire statement reads as under:

The Plaintiff Manishaben dictates that though the complaint is lodged against the Defendant Bhadresh, he is not improved till today. Our condition is becoming worst day by day. In these two days, Bhadresh is making horrible face reading while our access and is doing abusive and filthy behaviour. Yesterday, during the night hours at about 8.15 hours, mother of Bhadresh was speaking in a very loud tone in a way that I can hear the same as they are residing in front of us that we will pay maintenance and Bhadresh himself was speaking like this and telling me to live as his KEPT is also speaking like this. He is laughing in a satire manner in front of my house and he is also behaving with my husband in a abusive manner which could not be borne or disclosed. At this time, when we left from Sanand to come to Ahmedabad, workman of Bhadresh was chasing us and was behind us for about 3 to 4 km and I do not know if any other associates were of him or not going ahead, but his associates are remaining present surrounding me in a manner that he was keeping our watch chasing us even though I myself or my husband were not speaking anything. Now, I am worried about my daughter who is growing and becoming young because Bhadresh is also looking to her with bad intention. His intention appears to be mal.

I have dictated the above statement in full sound state of mind and without any undue pressure.

8. During preliminary inquiries, the Police recorded the statements of counsellors of Jyoti Sangh who confirmed that the prosecutrix had made the statement to them regarding alleged rape by the Appellant. Be that as it may, the FIR was registered only Under Section 506(2) of Indian Penal Code on 31.05.2001 bearing C.R. No. II.3009/2001 and on that basis, charge was framed only under the aforesaid Section on 25.06.2001. Further for one reason or the other, the prosecution case even under the said charge did not make any substantial progress.

9. On 07.12.2010, an application was moved by the prosecutrix for amending the charge by including the offence Under Section 376 Indian Penal Code as well on the basis of complaint dated 29.05.2001 and treating the same as FIR. Initially, the Metropolitan Magistrate did not agree with this request and passed an order to the effect that till the examination-in-chief of the prosecutrix was recorded, it was not justifiable to amend/alter the charge. However, in the revision petition filed against that order, the Sessions Court remanded the case for fresh consideration. After remand, the order dated 31.03.2012 was passed by the Metropolitan Magistrate directing further investigation Under Section 173(8) of the Code implying thereby that the necessity of framing of such charge would depend upon the investigation carried out by the Police. Without stating the details, it suffices to mention that the matter was taken by all the parties to the Sessions Court and then to the High Court. Thereafter, the prosecutrix even came up to this Court by way of SLP (Crl.) No. 636/2013 against the order dated 23.10.2012 passed by the High Court which had upheld the order of the Magistrate who had already ordered further investigation. Said SLP (Crl.) No. 636/2013 was disposed of on 04.02.2013 taking note of the fact that though the Metropolitan Magistrate had ordered further inquiry by the Police on 31.03.2012 with direction to submit the report within four weeks, no such report had been submitted till that date. On that basis, following order was passed:

We are informed that till today the police has not submitted the final report pursuant to the order passed by the Magistrate. If that is so, we are both surprised and pain at the inaction of the police and we direct the Investigating Officer of Criminal Case No. 51 of 2011, pending before the Metropolitan Magistrate, as directed by the Magistrate, and submit the final report within four weeks from the date of receipt/production of a copy of this order before him.

In view of the above direction, the Petitioner does not wish to press this special leave petition any longer. It is dismissed as not pressed.

10. Thereafter, the Police completed the investigation and submitted the report. The Police filed the chargesheet adding Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code against the Appellant and on that basis, an order was passed by the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate on 25.04.2013 thereby committing the case to the Sessions Court and further directing that the Appellant be taken into judicial custody, cancelling the bail bond. It is in these circumstances the Appellant moved an application for grant of anticipatory bail to the said Sessions Court which was granted on 18.05.2013. As already noted above, the order granting bail to the Appellant/accused has been cancelled by the High Court.

11. Mr. Dushyant Dave and Mr. Harin Raval, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Appellant took us through the material on record on the basis of which it was sought to be argued that there was acquaintance between the Appellant and the prosecutrix and the circumstances indicate that the physical relationship, if any, was consensual. It was also submitted that in her statement recorded before the IO on 31.05.2001, there was no allegation of rape; even when the charge was framed Under Section 506(2) Indian Penal Code the prosecutrix did not object to the framing of the said charge simplicitor or insist upon addition of charge Under Section 376 of Indian Penal Code as well; after a gap of more than 9 years from the framing of charge, application was moved for this purpose; in the fresh chargesheet filed by the IO, the IO clearly observed that no other circumstantial evidence could be collected regarding the rape as alleged by the complainant except her statement. It was also submitted that in the complaint made to Jyoti Sangh, NGO, at the end of the complaint which was given by the prosecutrix, there was a noting that no action be taken on the said complaint as the parties were trying to arrive at amicable settlement. The noting reads as under:

This case file be kept pending and whenever we want, only then, you do contest this case again and it is the wish of both of them, this case is kept pending.

It was also pointed out that between 2001 and 2010, the prosecutrix did not appear to give her statement. However, the statement of one Vandana Patva, counsel in the said NGO was recorded. Mr. Dave referred to the cross-examination of the said witness wherein this witness had admitted that in the statement dated 31.05.2001 recorded by the Police, no fact regarding rape was stated. It was also not mentioned as to at which place and at what time, incident of rape had taken place. The learned Senior Counsel, thus, submitted that in these circumstances the learned Additional Session Judge rightly granted anticipatory bail. The reasons adopted by the High Court in cancelling the bail were commented upon by the learned Counsel as not based on record, particularly, the observations of the High Court that the prosecutrix had to run a marathon for getting her complaint registered as a FIR and more particularly for addition of charge Under Section 376 of Indian Penal Code. They further submitted that the High Court wrongly recorded that the Sessions Court had failed to assign proper reasons for grant of anticipatory bail. It was pointed out that the move on the part of the Appellant in filing criminal cases against the husband of the prosecutrix, in which the prosecutrix husband was acquitted, is treated by the High Court as tampering with the evidence by disturbing the witnesses and on that basis, it is observed by the High Court that the Appellant was not entitled to the benefit of anticipatory bail. Submission in this behalf was that even if the complaint or cases lodged by the Appellant against the husband of the prosecutrix are presumed to be false, they had nothing to do with the instant case and, therefore, such acts on the part of the Appellant could never be treated as tampering with the evidence.

12. The prosecutrix appeared in person and argued her case. She extensively took us through the counter affidavit filed by her in opposition to the present proceedings on the basis of which she hammered the following aspects:

(a) The prosecutrix was harassed by the Appellant. First act of sexual intercourse was against her wishes and was clearly a rape. After committing this rape, the Appellant threatened her and started blackmailing her. On that basis, he took undue advantage of the hapless condition of the prosecutrix in which she was placed and committed subsequent acts of intercourse against her wishes which were nothing but commission of offences Under Section 376 of Indian Penal Code.

(b) Various letters were written by the Appellant not only to the prosecutrix but to her other family members as well, which showed his continued harassment to the prosecutrix and her family members.

(c) The Appellant was even having an evil eye on the prosecutrix's daughter who was of growing age and wanted to blackmail the prosecutrix in this behalf as well.

(d) In order to harass the prosecutrix, the Appellant even foisted false cases on the husband of the prosecutrix in order to pressurize the prosecutrix to withdraw the case in question.

(e) She also submitted that not only in the complaint made to Jyoti Sangh on 19.03.2001, she had levelled allegations of rape, but such allegations were also made in her complaint to the ACP on 29.05.2001. According to her, in fact, the statement which was recorded on 31.05.2001 by the IO was not correctly recorded who intentionally omitted her statement concerning her rape by the Appellant, though specifically stated. It is because of this reason that she had to file the application in the trial court for inclusion of charge Under Section 376 Indian Penal Code with the prayer that complaint dated 29.05.2001 before the ACP should be treated as the FIR and not the statement dated 31.05.2001 recorded by the IO.

(f) She also submitted that she had to come up to this Court to have the charge for offence Under Section 376 of Indian Penal Code framed against the Appellant.

13. Ms. Hemantika Wahi, learned Counsel appearing for the State, supported the plea of the prosecutrix. Her submission was that once the charge Under Section 376 Indian Penal Code has been added which was a serious charge and the offence being non-bailable, the proper course of action was to direct the Appellant to surrender before the trial court and apply for regular bail. Her submission was that having regard to the seriousness of this charge, it was not a case of anticipatory bail.

14. We have given our thoughtful and serious consideration to the aforesaid submissions on the charges, particularly, keeping in mind that there is a charge of rape against the Appellant and the case projected by the prosecutrix is that as a helpless and weak soul, she has been immensely harassed, physically abused and mentally tortured by the Appellant.

15. In the first place, it is necessary to remind ourselves that in the present proceedings, this Court is concerned not about the feasibility of framing of the charge Under Section 376 Indian Penal Code or merit thereof but to the grant of anticipatory bail to the Appellant. Therefore, the arguments of the prosecutrix that such a charge is rightly framed and the submissions on behalf of the Appellant attempting to find the loopholes and the weakness in the prosecution case, would not be of much relevance to the issue involved. At this stage, it cannot be said as to whether there was any physical relationship between the Appellant and the prosecutrix and, if so, whether it was consensual and, therefore, no charge of rape was made out. The fact remains that a charge of rape has been framed. It would ultimately be for the trial court to arrive at the findings as to whether such a charge stands proved or not, on the basis of evidence that would be produced by the prosecution in support of this charge. With these preliminary remarks, we advert to the core issue, namely, whether in the circumstances of this case, Appellant was entitled to anticipatory bail or not and whether the High Court was justified in cancelling the anticipatory bail.

16. For this purpose, we would first highlight the admitted position which runs as follows:

The allegations of rape go back to the years 1997-1998. No doubt, in the statement dated 19.03.2001 given to NGO Jyoti Sangh by the prosecutrix, she had levelled the allegations of rape. Equally, no doubt, she had repeated these allegations in her complaint to ACP on 29.05.2001 as well. However, for some curious reasons, the allegations of rape did not find mention in her statement recorded by the IO on 31.05.2001 on the basis of which FIR was registered. This possibility cannot be ruled out that the IO did not record the statement correctly and intentionally omitted to mention about the allegations of rape. Whether this, in fact, happened would be tested during trial. However, the fact remains that when the FIR was registered on the basis of statement recorded on 31.05.2001 and the chargesheet was filed making out a prima facie case only Under Section 506(2) of Indian Penal Code, the prosecutrix did not say anything at that time. There was no protest even when charge was framed by the concerned Magistrate only Under Section 506(2) Indian Penal Code. The objection in this regard was raised for the first time in the year 2008 i.e. almost 7 years after the framing of the charge and application was filed in the year 2010 for including the charge Under Section 376 Indian Penal Code as well on the ground that her complaint to the ACP given on 29.05.2001 be treated as FIR. The prosecutrix may have valid reasons for this delay. However, it is not for us to go into the same at this stage inasmuch as that is again a matter of trial and it would be for the Sessions Court to ultimately adjudge as to whether such delay was suitably explained and/or has any bearing on the merits of the charge. It is reiterated at the cost of repetition that we have to simply decide the question of feasibility of grant of anticipatory bail.

17. In a matter like this where allegations of rape pertain to the period which is almost 17 years ago and when no charge was framed Under Section 376 Indian Penal Code in the year 2001, and even the prosecutrix did not take any steps for almost 9 years and the charge Under Section 376 Indian Penal Code is added only in the year 2014, we see no reason why the Appellant should not be given the benefit of anticipatory bail. Merely because the charge Under Section 376 Indian Penal Code, which is a serious charge, is now added, the benefit of anticipatory bail cannot be denied when such a charge is added after a long period of time and inaction of the prosecutrix is also a contributory factor.

18. The High Court has remarked that the complainant had to run a marathon for getting her complaint registered as an FIR and more particularly for addition of charge Under Section 376 Indian Penal Code. In view of what we have mentioned above, these observations are not correct. Further, the High Court has also wrongly mentioned that the Sessions Court has not assigned proper reasons for grant of anticipatory bail. In fact, the reasons which have persuaded us and recorded above, are precisely the reasons given by the Sessions Court itself while granting anticipatory bail to the Appellant. The High Court has also wrongly observed that it is the Appellant who was able to drag the matter for a decade before the complaint was registered under proper Sections. The record of the case does not support this observation of the High Court. As far as the discussion in the impugned order commenting upon the conduct of the Appellant in filing false complaints and cases against the husband of the prosecutrix is concerned, we find that the High Court has made contradictory remarks on this aspect. At one place, such a move on the part of the Appellant is condemned as amounting to disturbing the witness and is treated as tampering with evidence. However, at another place, the High Court itself remarked that the complainant or the prosecutrix cannot get the anticipatory bail cancelled on this basis and the ground of misusing the order of bail after its grant is not made out. As per the High Court, the order of grant of bail by the Session Court itself was improper and that is the basis for cancelling the order passed by the Session Court.

19. Before we proceed further, we would like to discuss the law relating to grant of anticipatory bail as has been developed through judicial interpretative process. A judgment which needs to be pointed out is a Constitution Bench Judgment of this Court in the case of Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia and Ors. v. State of Punjab MANU/SC/0215/1980MANU/SC/0215/1980 : (1980) 2 SCC 565. The Constitution Bench in this case emphasized that provision of anticipatory bail enshrined in Section 438 of the Code is conceptualised Under Article 21 of the Constitution which relates to personal liberty. Therefore, such a provision calls for liberal interpretation of Section 438 of the Code in light of Article 21 of the Constitution. The Code explains that an anticipatory bail is a pre-arrest legal process which directs that if the person in whose favour it is issued is thereafter arrested on the accusation in respect of which the direction is issued, he shall be released on bail. The distinction between an ordinary order of bail and an order of anticipatory bail is that whereas the former is granted after arrest and therefore means release from the custody of the police, the latter is granted in anticipation of arrest and is therefore, effective at the very moment of arrest. A direction Under Section 438 is therefore intended to confer conditional immunity from the 'touch' or confinement contemplated by Section 46 of the Code. The essence of this provision is brought out in the following manner:

26. We find a great deal of substance in Mr. Tarkunde's submission that since denial of bail amounts to deprivation of personal liberty, the court should lean against the imposition of unnecessary restrictions on the scope of Section 438, especially when no such restrictions have been imposed by the legislature in the terms of that section. Section 438 is a procedural provision which is concerned with the personal liberty of the individual, who is entitled to the benefit of the presumption of innocence since he is not, on the date of his application for anticipatory bail, convicted of the offence in respect of which he seeks bail. An over-generous infusion of constraints and conditions which are not to be found in Section 438 can make its provisions constitutionally vulnerable since the right to personal freedom cannot be made to depend on compliance with unreasonable restrictions. The beneficent provision contained in Section 438 must be saved, not jettisoned. No doubt can linger after the decision in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India MANU/SC/0133/1978MANU/SC/0133/1978 : (1978) 1 SCC 248, that in order to meet the challenge of Article 21 of the Constitution, the procedure established by law for depriving a person of his liberty must be fair, just and reasonable. Section 438, in the form in which it is conceived by the legislature, is open to no exception on the ground that it prescribes a procedure which is unjust or unfair. We ought, at all costs, to avoid throwing it open to a Constitutional challenge by reading words in it which are not to be found therein.

20. Though the Court observed that the principles which govern the grant of ordinary bail may not furnish an exact parallel to the right to anticipatory bail, still such principles have to be kept in mind, namely, the object of bail which is to secure the attendance of the accused at the trial, and the proper test to be applied in the solution of the question whether bail should be granted or refused is whether it is probable that the party will appear to take his trial. Otherwise, bail is not to be withheld as a punishment. The Court has also to consider whether there is any possibility of the accused tampering with evidence or influencing witnesses etc. Once these tests are satisfied, bail should be granted to an undertrial which is also important as viewed from another angle, namely, an accused person who enjoys freedom is in a much better position to look after his case and to properly defend himself than if he were in custody. Thus, grant or non-grant of bail depends upon a variety of circumstances and the cumulative effect thereof enters into judicial verdict. The Court stresses that any single circumstance cannot be treated as of universal validity or as necessarily justifying the grant or refusal of bail. After clarifying this position, the Court discussed the inferences of anticipatory bail in the following manner:

31. In regard to anticipatory bail, if the proposed accusation appears to stem not from motives of furthering the ends of justice but from some ulterior motive, the object being to injure and humiliate the applicant by having him arrested, a direction for the release of the applicant on bail in the event of his arrest would generally be made. On the other hand, if it appears likely, considering the antecedents of the applicant, that taking advantage of the order of anticipatory bail he will flee from justice, such an order would not be made. But the converse of these propositions is not necessarily true. That is to say, it cannot be laid down as an inexorable rule that anticipatory bail cannot be granted unless the proposed accusation appears to be actuated by mala fides; and, equally, that anticipatory bail must be granted if there is no fear that the applicant will abscond. There are several other considerations, too numerous to enumerate, the combined effect of which must weigh with the court while granting or rejecting anticipatory bail. The nature and seriousness of the proposed charges, the context of the events likely to lead to the making of the charges, a reasonable possibility of the applicant's presence not being secured at the trial, a reasonable apprehension that witnesses will be tampered with and ""the larger interests of the public or the State"" are some of the considerations which the court has to keep in mind while deciding an application for anticipatory bail. The relevance of these considerations was pointed out in The State v. Captain Jagjit Singh MANU/SC/0139/1961MANU/SC/0139/1961 : AIR 1962 SC 253 : (1962) 3 SCR 622 : (1962) 1 Cri.LJ 216, which, though, was a case under the old Section 498 which corresponds to the present Section 439 of the Code. It is of paramount consideration to remember that the freedom of the individual is as necessary for the survival of the society as it is for the egoistic purposes of the individual. A person seeking anticipatory bail is still a free man entitled to the presumption of innocence. He is willing to submit to restraints on his freedom, by the acceptance of conditions which the court may think fit to impose, in consideration of the assurance that if arrested, he shall be enlarged on bail.

21. It is pertinent to note that while interpreting the expression ""may, if it thinks fit"" occurring in Section 438(1) of the Code, the Court pointed out that it gives discretion to the Court to exercise the power in a particular case or not, and once such a discretion is there merely because the accused is charged with a serious offence may not by itself be the reason to refuse the grant of anticipatory bail if the circumstances are otherwise justified. At the same time, it is also the obligation of the applicant to make out a case for grant of anticipatory bail. But that would not mean that he has to make out a ""special case"". The Court also remarked that a wise exercise of judicial power inevitably takes care of the evil consequences which are likely to flow out of its intemperate use.

22. Another case to which we would like to refer is the judgment of a Division Bench of this Court in the case of Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre v. State of Maharashtra and Ors. MANU/SC/1021/2010MANU/SC/1021/2010 : (2011) 1 SCC 694. This case lays down an exhaustive commentary of Section 438 of the Code covering, in an erudite fashion, almost all the aspects and in the process relies upon the aforesaid Constitution Bench judgment in Gurbaksh Singh's case. In the very first para, the Court highlighted the conflicting interests which are to be balanced while taking a decision as to whether bail is to be granted or not, as is clear from the following observations:

1. Leave granted. This appeal involves issues of great public importance pertaining to the importance of individual's personal liberty and the society's interest. Society has a vital interest in grant or refusal of bail because every criminal offence is the offence against the State. The order granting or refusing bail must reflect perfect balance between the conflicting interests, namely, sanctity of individual liberty and the interest of the society. The law of bails dovetails two conflicting interests, namely, on the one hand, the requirements of shielding society from the hazards of those committing crimes and potentiality of repeating the same crime while on bail and on the other hand, absolute adherence to the fun"

1. Leave granted.

2. The dispute essentially is as to whether HMOP No. 63 of 2014 on the file of Subordinate Judge, Karur, Tamil Nadu and HMOP No. 1050 of 2014, which is pending in the Family Court at Coimbatore, should be tried in Karur or in Coimbatore.

3. The learned Counsel on both sides have agreed that both the cases can be tried in Family Court at Coimbatore. Therefore, this appeal is disposed of by transferring HMOP No. 63 of 2013, pending in the Court of Subordinate Judge, Karur, Tamil Nadu to the Family Court at Coimbatore with a direction to the Family Court at Coimbatore to consolidate both the cases and dispose of the same expeditiously and preferably within six months from the date of first appearance of the parties pursuant to this order.

4. The parties shall appear before the Family Court at Coimbatore on 02.08.2016.

5. The Registry is directed to transmit a copy of this order to both the courts forthwith.

No costs.

1. An interesting question is raised in this appeal which arises out of two judgments of this Court, namely, 'Buxa Dooars Tea Co. Ltd. and Ors. v. State of West Bengal and Ors.' MANU/SC/0086/1989MANU/SC/0086/1989 : (1989) 3 SCC 211 and 'Goodricke Group Ltd. and Ors. v. State of W.B. and Ors.' MANU/SC/0964/1995MANU/SC/0964/1995 : 1995 Supp. (1) SCC 707.

2. In the present appeal, we are concerned with The West Bengal Rural Employment and Production Act, 1976 and The West Bengal Primary Education Act, 1973. The High Court has found, based on a reading of the interim orders passed in both Buxa Dooars Tea Company Ltd.'s case and Goodricke Group Ltd.'s case, that for the period prior to the Amendment Act of 1989, the Respondent herein is entitled to a refund of the cess paid by it together with interest at 12 per cent per annum, and has further found that insofar as interest is payable after the Amendment Act is concerned, such interest would only be payable after assessment orders are passed (which on facts here, we are informed, were passed on 27.07.1993 and thereafter).

3. By an interim order dated 16.06.1983 in the Buxa Dooars Tea Company Ltd.'s case, this Court held as hereunder:

Rule NISI. There will be no order on stay application but if the Petitioner succeeds in the writ petition, the State of West Bengal will refund the amount of cess collected with interest thereon @ 12% per annum from the date of collection.

4. By the judgment delivered in Buxa Dooars Tea Company Ltd.'s case in 1989, this Court held that the charging sections under both the aforesaid Acts were invalid both on the ground of legislative competence as well as violation of Article 301 inasmuch as the impugned legislative measures were outside Entry 49 in List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, which speaks of ""taxes of lands and buildings""; and it was further held that the levy being on movement of goods, Article 301 of the Constitution would be attracted and these levies are not saved Under Article 304(b) as no Presidential assent has been taken on either of these legislative measures.

5. The West Bengal legislature was swift to act after the judgment of this Court. By the West Bengal Taxation Laws (Second Amendment) Act of 1989 amending the provisions of both the aforesaid Acts, the charging sections were substituted with retrospective effect, and the levy of the rural employment cess and education cess (which was levied under the earlier principal Acts on the basis of despatch of manufactured tea) was now levied on the basis of production of tea leaves. A challenge to this Amendment Act was made before this Court which challenge failed in the second judgment referred to hereinabove (in Goodricke Group Ltd.'s case).

6. The 1989 Amendment Act was upheld in the following terms:

Lastly, the learned Counsel for the Petitioners questioned the validity of the retrospective effect given to the impugned enactment. We fail to see any substance in this submission. If the Act is good, it is good both prospectively and retrospectively. Retrospective effect is given for the period covered by the anterior provisions which were struck down in Buxa Dooars. Once we hold that the defect pointed out in Buxa Dooars is rectified and remedied in the impugned enactment, it can certainly be given retrospective effect to cover the period covered by the earlier enactment which is not only a well-known but a frequently adopted measure by all the legislatures.

For the above reasons, the writ petitions fail and are accordingly dismissed. The interim orders made in these writ petitions shall also come to an end. The Petitioners shall pay the cesses stayed by the orders of this Court along with interest @ 12% p.a. There shall no order as to costs.

7. It is a little important to note that before the final judgment in Goodricke Group Ltd.'s case, an interim order was passed dated 25.01.1990 in the following terms:

Issue notice. In the meantime the assessment may be made as usual but there will be no enforcement of demand under the Act or Rules. Status quo to be maintained as far as refund of Cess is concerned.

8. Learned Counsel for the Appellant Shri Anip Sachthey has argued before us that the impugned judgment should be set aside on the ground that the interim order dated 16.06.1983 in the Buxa Dooars Tea Company Ltd.'s case did not survive as it was substituted by the final order in the Buxa Dooars Tea Company Ltd.'s case, which is to be found in Para 16 thereof, which stated that the two West Bengal Acts were declared void and consequential refund ordered. There was no separate order as to payment of interest in the final judgment and therefore the interim order which merges with the final judgment had no independent existence. He has also urged that since the two West Bengal Acts were amended in 1989 with retrospective effect from 1981 and 1984 respectively, the basis of the judgment in Buxa Dooars Tea Company Ltd.'s case was removed and as a result, it is clear that no refund at all is payable.

9. Mr. C.U. Singh, learned senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondent, on the other hand, supported the judgment on both counts and submitted that the levy under the original Act no longer remained the same, so that the levy under the 1989 amendment was a separate and new levy of rural employment cess and education cess, and this being the position, the interim order as well as the final judgment in Buxa Dooars Tea Company Ltd.'s case still remain intact. He further submitted that the interim order was self operative inasmuch as interest became payable at the rate of 12 per cent the moment the writ petitions were finally decided in the Petitioner's favour. He also supported the second portion of the impugned judgment saying that the final order in Goodricke Group Ltd.'s case is to be read with the interim order thereof and if so read, the result is that interest is only payable under the new Act with effect from the date of assessment and not before.

10. We have heard learned Counsel for the parties. In our opinion, Mr. C.U. Singh, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondents, is right in saying that the interim order dated 16.06.1983 is self operative. In any case, the final order in Buxa Dooars Tea Company Ltd.'s case did not say anything to the contrary, and when both the judgment and the interim order are read together, it is clear that the refund will have to be made together with 12 per cent interest.

11. But the matter does not end here. The Amendment Act contains two very important provisions, namely, Section 4B of the West Bengal Rural Employment and Production Act and Section 78C of the West Bengal Primary Education Act. Both the sections are set out hereinbelow:

4B. (1) Where any sum has been paid by, or collected from, any owner of a tea estate during the period commencing on the 1st day of April, 1981 and ending on the day immediately preceding the date of coming into force of the West Bengal Taxation Laws (Second Amendment) Act, 1989 as rural employment cess in respect of any period prior to the coming into force of the said Act, such portion of the said sum as may become payable in accordance with the provisions of this Act after the coming into force of the said Act shall, notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any court, be deemed to have been validly levied, paid or collected under this Act, and where after assessment or fresh assessment any portion of such sum is found to have been levied, paid or collected in excess of the rural employment cess payable for the said period shall be refunded to such owner in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder.

(2) Where any assessment is purported to have been made, or any order is purported to have been passed on appeal, revision or review, by any authority, or any appeal or application for revision or review has been made before such authority under this Act, or any order has been passed by a court or where any sum has been paid or collected as rural employment cess, before the coming into force of the West Bengal Taxation Laws (Second Amendment) Act, 1989, in respect of any period prior to the coming into force of the said Act, assessment or fresh assessment shall, notwithstanding such order on appeal, revision or review, or the pendency of such appeal or application for revision or review, or any order passed by a court, be made in accordance with the provisions of this Act within four years from the date of coming into force of the said Act.

(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, any default by an owner of a tea estate to make payment of the rural employment cess or to apply for registration or to file return in accordance with the provisions of this Act after the coming into force of the West Bengal Taxation Laws (Second Amendment) Act, 1989 in respect of any period prior to the coming into force of the said Act shall not be deemed to be a contravention of such provisions if such owner makes payment of such rural employment cess within one month or files return within six months, as the case may be, from the date of coming into force of the said Act.

(4) The amount of the rural employment cess payable by any owner of a tea estate Under Sub-section (2A) of Section 4 of this Act in respect of any period prior to the coming into force of the West Bengal Taxation Laws (Second Amendment) Act, 1989, shall, notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, be reduced by such amount of rural employment cess payable in respect of such tea estate on such quantity of green tea leaves produced therein during the said period as may be equivalent to the quantity of any tea despatched for which such owner has purported to have enjoyed or would have enjoyed exemption from payment of the rural employment cess during such period, and it is hereby declared that for determining the amount of the rural employment cess to be reduced, each kilogram of tea despatched during such period shall be equivalent to four and a half kilograms of green tea leaves produced in such tea estate.

78C. ""Validation and exemption. (1) Where any sum has been paid by, or collected from, any owner of a tea estate during the period commencing on the 14th day of April, 1984 and ending on the day immediately preceding the date of coming into force of the West Bengal Taxation Laws (Second Amendment) Act, 1989 as education cess in respect of any period prior to the coming into force of the said Act, such portion of the said sum as may become payable in accordance with the provisions of this Act after the coming into force of the said Act shall be deemed to have been validly levied, paid or collected under this Act, and where after assessment any portion of such sum is found to have been levied, paid or collected in excess of the amount payable as education cess for the said period shall be refunded to such owner in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder.

(2) Where any assessment is purported to have been made, or any order is purported to have been passed on appeal, revision or review, by any authority, or any appeal or application for revision or review has been made before such authority under this Act, or any order has been passed by a court, or where any sum has been paid or collected as education cess, before the coming into force of the West Bengal Taxation Laws (Second Amendment) Act, 1989, in respect of any period prior to the coming into force of the said Act, assessment or fresh assessment shall, notwithstanding such order on appeal, revision or review or the pendency of such appeal or application for revision or review or any order passed by any court, be made in accordance with the provisions of this Act within four years from the date of coming into force of the said Act.

(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, any default by an owner of a tea estate to make payment of the education cess or to apply for registration or to file return in accordance with the provisions of this Act after the coming into force of the West Bengal Taxation Laws (Second Amendment) Act, 1989 in respect of any period prior to the coming into force of the said Act shall not be deemed to be a contravention of such provisions if such owner makes payment of such education cess within three months or applies for registration within one month or files return within six months, as the case may be, from the date of coming into force of the said Act.

(4) The amount of the education cess payable by any owner of a tea estate Under Sub-section (2A) of Section 78 of this Act in respect of any period prior to the coming into force of the West Bengal Taxation Laws (Second Amendment) Act, 1989, shall notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, be reduced by such amount of education cess payable in respect of such tea estate on such quantity of green tea leaves produced therein during the said period as may be equivalent to the quantity of any tea despatched for which such owner has purported to have enjoyed or would have enjoyed exemption from payment of the education cess during such period, and it is hereby declared that for determining the amount of the education cess to be reduced, each kilogram of tea despatched during such period shall be equivalent to four and a half kilograms of green tea leaves produced in such tea estate.

(5) The provisions of this section shall have effect, notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any court, tribunal or other authority to the contrary.

12. It is clear from a reading of Section 4B and 78C that where any sum is paid by or collected from an owner of a tea estate during a period commencing from 01.04.1981 or 14.04.1984, as the case may be, up to the date of the Amendment Act as rural employment cess or as education cess, such portion of the said sum as may become payable under the provisions of the Amendment Act shall, notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any court, be deemed to have been validly levied, paid or collected under the Amendment Act.

13. In our view, the purport of these two sections is clear. Whatever may have been the subject matter of Buxa Dooars Tea Company Ltd.'s case, that is the subject matter of the two Acts as originally enacted, will now, notwithstanding the interim order or the final judgment in Buxa Dooars Tea Company Ltd.'s case, be deemed to have been validly levied, collected and paid as rural employment cess and education cess under the Amendment Act.

14. This being the case, it is clear that Section 4B and Section 78C have changed the basis of the law as it existed when Buxa Dooars Tea Company Ltd.'s case was decided and consequentially, the judgment and interim order passed in Buxa Dooars Tea Company Ltd.'s case will cease to have any effect. Also, what would have been payable under the Act as unamended, is now payable only under the 1989 Amendment Act which has come into force with retrospective effect.

15. Mr. C.U. Singh, however, referred us to 'Madan Mohan Pathak v. Union of India and Ors.' MANU/SC/0253/1978MANU/SC/0253/1978 : 1978 (3) SCR 334 and in particular to Justice P.N. Bhagwati's judgment thereof, in which it has been decided by this Court that a Legislative Act cannot directly undo a writ of mandamus that is granted by an order of a superior court. We are of the view that Madan Mohan Pathak's case would not apply to the facts in the present case for the simple reason that what has been undone by Section 4B and Section 78C is not a mandamus issued by a superior court. What is undone is the very basis of the judgment in Buxa Dooars Tea Company Ltd.'s case by retrospectively changing the levy of rural employment cess and education cess. It must be understood that rural employment cess and education cess continue to be the same cess whether before or after the Amendment Act. What has been changed is the basis for the said levy so as to undo the defects that were found in the Buxa Dooars Tea Company Ltd.'s case judgment. It is obvious that when the basis of Buxa Dooars Tea Company Ltd.'s case has gone, on a retrospective amendment of these two acts, the interim order and the judgment and order in Buxa Dooars Tea Company Ltd.'s case can no longer survive. For this reason, we are of the view that the impugned judgment needs to be set aside on this score. In fact, Madan Mohan Pathak has been explained in Indian Aluminium Co. v. State of Kerala MANU/SC/0370/1996MANU/SC/0370/1996 : (1996) 7 SCC 637 as follows:

49. In Madan Mohan Pathak v. Union of India MANU/SC/0253/1978MANU/SC/0253/1978 : (1978) 2 SCC 50 : 1978 SCC (L and S) 103, on the basis of a settlement, bonus became payable by LIC to its Class III and Class IV employees. In a writ, a Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court issued mandamus directing payment of bonus as provided in the settlement. During the pendency of letters patent appeal, LIC (Modification of Settlements) Act, 1976 was enacted denying bonus payable to the employees. The appeal was withdrawn. The validity of 1976 Act was challenged in this Court Under Article 32 of the Constitution. A Bench of seven Judges had held that Parliament was not aware of the mandamus issued by the court and it was declared that the 1976 Act was void and writ of mandamus was issued to obey the mandamus by implementing or enforcing the provisions of that Act and directed payment of bonus in terms of the settlement. It was pointed out that there was no reference to the judgment of the High Court in the Statement of Objects and Reasons, nor any non obstante clause referring to the judgment of the Court was made in Section 3 of the Act. Attention of Parliament was not drawn to the mandamus issued by the High Court. When the mandamus issued by the High Court became final, the 1976 Act was held invalid. Shri R.F. Nariman laid special emphasis on the observations of learned Chief Justice Beg who in a separate judgment had pointed out that the basis of the mandamus issued by the court could not be taken away by indirect fashion as observed at p. 743c to f. From the observations made by Bhagwati, J. per majority, it is clear that this Court did not intend to lay down that Parliament, under no circumstance, has power to amend the law removing the vice pointed out by the court. Equally, the observation of Chief Justice Beg is to be understood in the context that as long as the effect of mandamus issued by the court is not legally and constitutionally made ineffective, the State is bound to obey the directions. Thus understood, it is unexceptionable. But it does not mean that the learned Chief Justice intended to lay down the law that mandamus issued by court cannot at all be made ineffective by a valid law made by the legislature, removing the defect pointed out by the court.

16. This statement of law has been accepted in yet another judgment of this Court. (See: State of Kerala v. Peoples Union for Civil Liberties, Kerala State Unit and Ors. MANU/SC/1302/2009MANU/SC/1302/2009 : (2009) 8 SCC 46 at paragraph 65.

17. Bhagwati, J.'s judgment in Madan Mohan Pathak also makes it clear that Section 3 of the impugned Act in that case sought to modify a settlement dated 24th January, 1974 arrived at between the LIC and its employees. There was no reference to a Mandamus issued by the Calcutta High Court in the Statement of Objects and Reasons as a result of which Section 3 of the impugned Act did not contain a non-obstante clause referring to any judgment of any court. The right given under the said judgment was therefore not sought to be taken away by the impugned Act. Further, inexplicably, the Letters Patent Appeal filed by the LIC was not pressed as otherwise Section 3 of the impugned Act would only have to be applied to the facts in that case to upset the Single Judge judgment that had issued the Writ of Mandamus. Bhagwati, J. also went on to state that the judgment given by the Calcutta High Court was not a mere declaratory judgment holding an impost or tax to be invalid, so that a validation statute can remove the defect pointed out by the judgment and amend the law with retrospective effect to validate such impost or tax-See: Madan Mohan Pathak v. Union of India MANU/SC/0253/1978MANU/SC/0253/1978 : (1978) 3 SCR 334 at 352 to 355

18. In the present case, the 1989 amendment Act expressly seeks to remove the basis of Buxa dooars's judgment by retrospectively changing the basis of the levy of the cesses mentioned above. In the present case, what is done away with by the Amending Act of 1989 is a declaratory judgment holding the above cesses to be invalid. On all these grounds also the judgment in Madan Mohan Pathak's case is distinguishable.

19. However, insofar as interest is concerned, post Goodricke Group Ltd.'s case, we are of the view that Mr. C.U. Singh is correct in supporting the impugned judgment. Goodricke Group Ltd.'s case made it clear that the Petitioners shall pay cesses stayed by an order of this Court along with interest at 12 per cent per annum. The expression ""cesses stayed"" has reference to the interim order dated 25.01.1990 which had stated that there would be no enforcement of demand under the Act or Rules and in the meanwhile, assessment may be made. We have been informed that assessments were made with effect from July, 1993 onwards and consequential demands have been made with effect from 1995 onwards. It is clear, therefore, that the impugned judgment is right in holding that with regard to the payment of interest by the Petitioner on the amount of cess payable by virtue of the Goodricke Group Ltd.'s case, interest would only be payable from the respective dates of assessment for the various relevant periods till recovery. On facts here, no question arises as to whether interest would become payable from the date of demand or from the date of the assessments inasmuch as counsel for the Respondents supports the impugned judgment on this score and is not aggrieved thereby.

20. The Respondents here have made payment of interest from time to time to the State. These payments will be adjusted against any sum that would become payable as a result of this judgment.

21. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.

CONTEMPT PETITION (C) No. 320 of 2013 IN CIVIL APPEAL No. 3734 of 2015 [@ SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (C) No. 15507 of 2013]

11. In view of the order passed by us today in Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) 15507 of 2013, no further orders need be passed in the Contempt Petition and it is, accordingly, disposed of.

"

1. The Petitioner is being tried before the Sessions Judge, Jodhpur for offences punishable Under Sections 370(4), 342, 354A, 376(2)(f), 376D, 506, 509/34, 120B, Indian Penal Code, Sections 23 and 26, Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 and Sections 5(F)/6, 5(G)/6, 7/8, Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act, 2012. As earlier application for bail filed by him having been declined, a second application was moved before the Trial Court which too came to be rejected by the said Court. The matter was then taken up before the High Court who has concurred with the view taken by the Trial Court and dismissed the plea for bail. The present special leave petition calls in question the correctness of the said order.

2. When this petition initially came up before us on 15.10.2014 Mr. Salman Khurshid, learned senior counsel appearing for the Appellant submitted that although several witnesses for the prosecution had already been examined at the trial, the Petitioner shall be satisfied if he is permitted to refresh his application for enlargement on bail after the examination of the material witnesses. The prosecution has it is common ground named six material witnesses in terms of a list filed before this Court, two out of whom have already been examined and cross-examined while the third is still under cross-examination, although the Petitioner's counsel has concluded the cross examination on his part. This implies that there are still three other witnesses apart from the one who is under cross-examination that need to be examined at the trial. Mr. Khurshid's submission that the Petitioner will be satisfied if he is allowed to refresh his application for enlargement on bail after examination of the material witnesses clearly implied that the application for bail on merit was as good as withdrawn till such time the material witnesses were examined before the Trial Court. What had all the same been argued by Mr. Khurshid was that the medical condition of the Petitioner called for immediate surgery for which purpose he had placed reliance upon a certificate issued by Dr. Maheep Singh Gaur. It was argued that the Petitioner would like to be evaluated at Kumud Chawla Gamma Knife Centre, Goodwill Hospital and Research Centre, NOIDA. We had in view of this submission made at the Bar directed constitution of a Medical Board by the Director of AI-IMS to review the medical papers relevant to the Petitioner's present condition and to submit a report as to whether there was any need for surgery as suggested by the Petitioner's doctor. We had left it open to the Medical Board to call the Petitioner for a clinical examination should if it considered necessary to do so.

3. A Board comprising as many as 8 Doctors from different specialities was accordingly constituted by the AIIMS before whom the Petitioner was produced in person for a clinical examination, apart from evaluation of his medical papers. The Board has based on their clinical examination and investigations submitted a report dated 02.01.2015 in which it has opined:

""On basis of above examination and investigations by the Medical Board, he was diagnosed to be suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia with degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine with Hypothyroidism and Benign Hyperplasia of Prostate. Radiological and blood investigation reports are enclosed in original.

At present, none of the above mentioned disease require surgical management but requires appropriate routine medical management on OPD basis.

The medical board concluded at 6.00 p.m.""

4. It is evident from that above that the Petitioner does not require any surgical intervention at this stage and that the diseases which he is found to be suffering from like Trigeminal Neuralgia, degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine, Hypothyroidism and Benign Hyperplasia of Prostate can be handled in the OPD. We have no reason to doubt or reject the opinion given by the experts from the premier medical institute of the country. Mr. Vikas Singh, learned senior counsel all the same argued that some of the diseases namely degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine with Hypothyroidism and Benign Hyperplasia of Prostate was developed by the Petitioner during incarnation. There is nothing before us to support even that submission of Learned Counsel. Be that as it may since the Board has suggested only medical management on OPD basis, there is no compelling reason for us to enlarge the Petitioner on bail at this stage when the Petitioner is facing serious charges some of which are punishable by imprisonment for life.

5. Mr. Vikas Singh at this stage submitted that the Petitioner has been earlier treated by Dr. Arun Kumar Tyagi, Arogayadham Hospital and would like to continue with the treatment advised by him. There is no serious objection to that prayer being allowed. We also see no reason why the Doctor named by Learned Counsel for the Petitioner should not be allowed to visit the Petitioner in jail to administer such treatment as is considered necessary of course at the risk of the Petitioner.

6. It was next contended by Mr. Vikas Singh that the three witnesses described as material witnesses by the prosecution have not appeared despite efforts made by the Trial Court. He submits that in any case those witnesses are not material for purpose of determining whether the incident in question had indeed taken place. On behalf of the Respondent it was submitted that the Respondents had named only six out of a total of 58 witnesses as material witnesses, three of whom are already examined as mentioned earlier while the remaining three will be produced no sooner the third witness correctly made cross-examination is discharged. In that view all that we need to say is that the trial court shall take such steps as are necessary to ensure that the trial of the Petitioner does not get delayed unduly because of nonavailability of witnesses. The trial will we are confident take all such steps as are necessary to have the witnesses served and produced before the Trial Court on such dates as may be fixed by it. With these observations this special leave petition fails and is hereby dismissed. Needless to say that after the recording of the material witnesses is complete, the Petitioner shall be free to move a fresh application for grant of bail to him. In case any such application is made the trial court shall consider the same on its merits. We express no opinion on the merits of any such application.

SLP (C) Nos. 4916 of 2014 and 4918-4919 of 2014:

S.B. Sinha, J.

1. Leave granted.

2. The complainant is the appellant herein. He lodged a First Information Report against the respondent on 19th July, 1997, alleging, inter alia, therein that a sale-deed and acknowledgment purported to have been executed by him were forged and fabricated documents and the respondent wrongfully trespassed into the lands bearing Survey Nos. 100/1 and 101/ situate at Serlingampaly in the District of Ranga Reddy, Andhra Pradesh. the Forensic Science Laboratory to whom the said sale-deed and acknowledgment were sent for a scientific opinion allegedly in its opinion dated 31st October, 1997 stated that the said sale-deed and acknowledgement were forged documents.

3. However, in the meanwhile being not satisfied with the investigation carried out by the police authorities, he filed a criminal complaint in the Court of the Additional Judicial First Class Magistrate, (West and South), Saroornagar in the District of Ranga Reddy against the respondent herein, alleging commission of offences under Sections 420, 426, 447 and 448 of the Indian Penal Code. It is admitted that two civil suits are also pending between the parties. The Investigating Officer, however, upon investigation of the matter came to the conclusion that the dispute between the parties was a civil dispute. He also arrived at a conclusion that the appellant herein had executed the acknowledgment. A case disposal report on the said basis was filed before the learned Magistrate.

4. The appellant herein on or about 2nd September, 1998 filed a protest petition.

5. The case disposal report filed by the police was accepted by the learned Magistrate. The complainant case filed by the appellant was also closed. The said order has not been questioned by the him.

6. On or about 8th November, 2002, a third complaint was filed by the appellant herein purported to be under Section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure whereupon summons were issued upon the respondent.

7. Questioning the said order, the respondent filed an application under Section 182 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the High Court of Judicature at Andhra Pradesh which was marked as Criminal Petition No. 591 of 1999. By reason of the impugned judgment dated 31st August, 2001, a learned Single Judge of the High Court held that having regard to the police report in Cr. No. 206 of 1997 dated 29th July, 1997 that the dispute between the parties was of civil in nature and further having regard to the dismissal of the protest petition filed by the appellant herein on 2nd September, 1998, a fresh complaint on the self same allegations, was barred.

8. Mr. P.S. Narasimha, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant in support of the appeal, would, inter alia, submit that the High Court committed a manifest error in arriving at the said conclusion as thee does not exist any legal bar in filing a second complaint. Strong reliance, in this connection, has been placed on a judgment of the Patna High Court in Munilal Thakur and Ors. etc. v. Nawal Kishore Thakur and Anr. MANU/BH/0245/1984MANU/BH/0245/1984 and a decision of a learned Single Judge of the Orissa High Court in The District Manager, Food Corporation of India, Titilagarh v. Jayashankar Mund and Anr. MANU/OR/0151/1989MANU/OR/0151/1989 : 67(1989)CLT426 .

9. Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent, on the other hand, would submit that the criminal complaint filed by the appellant herein was a verbatim reproduction of his earlier complaint petition and in that view of the matter unless a special case was made out, the learned Magistrate could not have entertained the said criminal contempt nor could issue processes upon the respondent relying on the basis thereof.

10. Strong reliance, in this connection, has been placed on Pramatha Nath Taluqdar v. Saroj Ranjan Sarkar MANU/SC/0149/1961MANU/SC/0149/1961 : (1962) Supp. 2 SCR 297 and Bindeshwari Prasad Singh v. Kali Singh MANU/SC/0100/1976MANU/SC/0100/1976 : 1978CriLJ187 .

11. The learned counsel sought to place before us an authenticated copy the said complaint petition with a view to show that the same was almost a verbatim reproduction of the earlier complaint petition.

12. There cannot be any doubt or dispute that only because the Magistrate has accepted a final report, the same by itself would not stand in his way to take cognizance of the offence on a protest/complaint petition; but the question which is required to be posed and answered would be as to under what circumstances the said power can be exercised.

13. The law in this behalf is no longer res integra.

14. In Pramatha Nath Taluqdar's case (supra), Kapur, J., speaking for himself and Hidayatullah, J., as he then was, observed:

""....Therefore if he has not misdirected himself as to the scope of the enquiry made under Section 202, Criminal Procedure Code, and has judicially applied his mind to the material before him and then proceeds to make his order it cannot be said that he has acted erroneously. An order of dismissal under Section 203, Criminal Procedure Code is, however, no bar to the entertainment of s second complaint on the same facts but it will be entertained only in exceptional circumstances, e.g., where the previous order was passed on an incomplete record or on a misunderstanding of the nature of the complaint or it was manifestly absurd, unjust or foolish or where new facts which could not, with reasonable diligence, have been brought on the record in the previous proceedings have been adduced. It cannot be said to be in the interests of justice that after a decision has been given against the complainant upon a full consideration of his case, he or any other person should be given another opportunity to have his complaint enquired into Allah Ditta v. Karam Baksh, Ram Narain Chaubey v. Panachand Jain, Hansabai v. Ananda, Doraisami v. Subramania. In regard to the adducing of new facts for the bringing of a fresh complaint the Special Bench in the judgment under appeal did not accept the view of the Bombay High Court or the Patna High Court in cases above quoted an adopted the opinion of Macleam, C.J. in Queen Empress v. Dolegobinda Das affirmed by a full Bench in Dwarka Nath Mandal v. Benimadhab Banerji. It held therefore that a fresh complaint can be entertained where there is manifest error, or manifest miscarriage of justice in the previous order or when fresh evidence is forthcoming.""

15. S.K. Das, J. delivering the minority judgment also observed:

""The question was then considered by a Full Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Dwarka Nath Mondul v. Beni Madhab Banerjee and it was held by the Full Bench (Ghose, J. Dissenting) that a Presidency Magistrate was competent to rehear a warrant case triable under Ch. XXI of the Code of Criminal Procedure in which he had earlier discharged the accused person. Nilratan Sen's case and Kamal Chandra Pal's case were referred to in the arguments as summarized in the report, but the view expressed therein was not accepted. Dealing with the question Prinsep, J. said:

""There is no bar to further proceedings under the law, and, therefore, a Magistrate to whom a complaint has been made under such circumstances, is bound to proceed in the manner set out in Section 200, that is, to examine the complaint, and, unless he has reason to distrust the truth of the complaint, or for some other reason expressly recognized by law, such as, if he finds that no offence had been committed, he is bound to take cognizance of the offence on a complaint, and, unless he has good reason to doubt the truth of the complaint, he is bound to do justice to the complainant, to summon his witnesses and to hear them in the presence of the accused.""

The same view was expressed by the Madras High Court In re. Koyassan Kutty and it was observed that there was nothing in law against the entertainment of a second complaint on the same facts on which a person had already been discharged, inasmuch as a discharge was not equivalent to an acquittal. This view was reiterated in Kumariah v. Chinna Naicker, where it was held that the fact that a previous complaint had been dismissed under Section 203 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was no bar to the entertainment of a second complaint. In Hansabai Sayaji v. Ananda Ganuji the question was examined with reference to a large number of earlier decisions of several High Courts on the subject and it was held that there was nothing in law against the entertainment of a second complaint on the same facts. The same view was also expressed in Ram Narain v. Panachand Jain, Ramanand v. Sheri and Allah Ditta v. Karam Baksh. In all these decisions it was recognized further that though there was nothing in law to bar the entertainment of a second complaint on the same facts, exceptional circumstances must exist for entertainment of a second complaint when on the same allegations a previous complaint had been dismissed.....I accept the view expressed by the High Courts that there is nothing in law which prohibits the entertainment of a second complaint on the same allegations when a previous complaint had been dismissed under Section 203 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. I also accept the view that as a rule of necessary caution and of proper exercise of the discretion given to a Magistrate under Section 261(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, exceptional circumstances must exist for the entertainment of a second complaint on the same allegations; in other words, there must be good reasons why the Magistrate thinks that there is ""sufficient ground for proceeding"" with the second complaint, when a previous complaint on the same allegations was dismissed under Section 203 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.""

16. The learned Judge posed the question as to what would be those exceptional circumstances. Noticing the decisions in Queen Empress v. Dolegobinda Dass ILR(1990) Cal. 211, In re. Koyassan Kutty AIR 1918, Mad. 494, Kumariah v. Chinna Naicker AIR 1946 Mad. 167 and several other decisions, the learned Judge came to the conclusion:

""It will be noticed that in the test thus laid down the exceptional circumstances are brought under three categories; (1) manifest error, (2) manifest miscarriage of justice, and (3) new facts which the complainant had no knowledge of or could not with reasonable diligence have brought forward in the previous proceedings. Any exceptional circumstances coming within any one or more of the aforesaid three categories would fulfil the test. In Ram Narain v. Panachand Jain it was observed that an exhaustive list of the exceptional circumstances could not be given though some of the categories were mentioned. One new category mentioned was where the previous order of dismissal was passed on an incomplete record or a misunderstanding of the nature of the complaint. This new category would perhaps fall with the category of manifest error or miscarriage of justice.

It appears to me that the test laid down in the earliest of the aforesaid decisions. Queen Empress v. Dolegobind Dass in really wide enough to cover the other categories mentioned in the later decisions. Whenever a Magistrate is satisfied that the previous order of dismissal was due to a manifest error or has resulted in a miscarriage of justice, he can entertain a second complaint on the same allegations even though an earlier complaint was dismissed under Section 203 of the Code of Criminal Procedure....""

17. Yet again in Bindeshwari Prasad's case (supra), this Court followed Pramatha Nath Taluqdar's case (supra) holding:-

""....it is now well-settled that a second complaint can lie only on fresh facts or even on the previous facts only if a special case is made out...""

18. In Munilal Thakur's case (supra), the Division Bench of the Patna High Court was concerned with the question as to whether a Magistrate even after accepting final report filed by the police, can take cognizance of offence upon a complaint or the protest petition on same or similar allegations of fact; to which the answer was rendered in the affirmative.

19. The question which has arisen for consideration herein neither arose therein nor was canvassed.

20. In Jayashankar Mund's case, the Orissa High Court again did not have any occasion to consider the question raised herein. The Court held:

""....Even though a protest petition is in the nature of a complaint, it is referable to the investigation already held by the vigilance police culminating in the final report and because the informant was not examined on solemn affirmation under Section 202 of the Code, thereby no illegality or prejudice was caused to the accused. If such a view is accepted and there is no reason why such a view should not be accepted, the necessary, consequence in this particular case shall be that the protest petition which is of the nature of a complaint petition filed by the petitioner shall be in continuation and in respect of the case instituted and investigated by the vigilance police...""

21. Keeping in view the settled legal principles, we are of the opinion that the High Court was not correct in holding that the second complaint was completely barred. It is settled law that there is no statutory bar in filing a second complaint on the same facts. In a case where a previous complaint is dismissed without assigning any reasons, the Magistrate under Section 204 Cr.P.C. may take cognizance of an offence and issue process if there is sufficient ground for proceeding. As held in Pramatha Nath Taluqdar's case (supra) second complaint could be dismissed after a decision has been given against the complainant in previous matter upon a full consideration of his case. Further, second complaint on the same facts could be entertained only in exceptional circumstances, namely, where the previous order was passed on an incomplete record or on a misunderstanding of the nature of complaint or it was manifestly absurd, unjust or where new facts which could not, with reasonable diligence, have been brought on record in the previous proceedings, have been adduced. In the facts and circumstances of this case, the matter, therefore, should have been remitted back to the learned Magistrate for the purpose of arriving at a finding as to whether any case for cognizance of the alleged offence had been made out or not.

22. For the reasons aforementioned, the impugned order of the High Court is set aside. The matter shall now go back to the learned Magistrate who shall consider the matter afresh in the light of the observations made hereinbefore.

23. This appeal thus stand disposed of. In the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs.

"

1. The Election Commission issued a Notification calling upon the electorates to elect the Members of the Legislative Assembly in the State of U.P. The date of Notification of election was 16th January, 2002 and the last date for filing nomination papers was 23rd January, 2002. The last date for withdrawal of nomination was 28th January, 2002. The date of poll was 21st February, 2002. In the said election, the appellant herein and respondent-No. 1 were the contesting candidates. As a result of counting of votes, respondent No. 1 was declared elected as having received the majority of valid votes. The appellant herein filed a petition questioning the election of respondent No. 1 as Member of Legislative Assembly from 346 Govardhan (S.C.) Assembly Constituency. The election petition purported to be based on the ground that respondent No. 1 is not a member of Scheduled Caste. After the notices were issued by the High Court in the election petition, respondent No. 1 filed an application under Order 6 Rule 16 of the Code of Civil Procedure, (sic), for striking off the grounds (i) to (v) and paragraphs 5-29 of election petition on the ground that those paragraphs did not contain material facts as required under Section 81(3) of the Representation of People Act, 1951 (for short 'the Act'). The High Court was of the view that since no fact warranting declaring the election of the respondent herein void had been alleged and the documents referred to therein having not been supplied, the same does not satisfy the requirement of Section 81 of the Act. Since the election of respondent No. 1 was not challenged on any other ground, the High Court dismissed the petition. It is in this way, the appellant has preferred this appeal under Section 116A of the Act, challenging the judgment of the High Court.

2. We have heard counsel for the parties.

3. The sole question which arises in this case is whether there was a pleading as regards the ground that respondent No. 1 is not a member of the Scheduled Caste. The relevant paragraphs to this effect runs as under:

""4. That the election of respondent No. 1 (Shyam) is void on the following grounds:

GROUNDS

(i) .......

(ii) Because the respondent No. 1 with the malafide intention and Freud (sic), obtained a caste certificate showing himself a person belonging to scheduled caste and wrongly and fraudulent (sic) contested the election from the seat which is reserved for scheduled caste where as in fact he does not belong to scheduled caste.

(iii) .....

6. That the respondent No. 1 had filed the nomination paper and annexed his casts certificate showing himself to be of scheduled caste. The caste certificate was issued in favour of the respondent No. 1 by Tehsildar, Mathura on 16.7.2001 showing in belonging to Bahelia caste.

7. That in 1991 the respondent No. 1 was issued a caste certificate showing him as of Agaria caste. The caste certificate was issued by the Tehsildar, Mathura on 8.3.1991 as per the SCHEDULE A.

8. That the respondent No. 1 had contested the election of member of Zila Panchayat in 1995 from ward No. 15 which is a reserved constituency and with his nomination paper, he had annexed a caste certificate showing himself belonging to the scheduled caste.

9. That an election petition, was filed by one Laxman Singh against the respondent No. 1 challenging his caste as scheduled caste and it was asserted by the petitioner that Shyam Singh belongs to Aheria caste which is a backward caste.

10. That it is pertinent to mention that the brother of Shyam Singh namely Virendra Singh had filed an affidavit in the aforesaid election petition and said that they belong to Aheria caste which is a backward caste and not a scheduled caste.

11. That it is relevant to mention that the Daughter of the respondent Rani Kumari was studying in Shree Chameli Devi Khandelwal Girls Inter College, Mathura which issued a transfer certificate to the Rani Kumari on 4.3.2.002 which contents the caste as Aheria which is the caste of the respondent No. 1.

12. That the facts stated above is conclusive evidence to prove that the respondent No. 1 does not belong to scheduled caste and he is the member of the backward caste as such, his nomination paper ought to have been rejected as per the Section 36(2) of the representation of people act.

13. That the petitioner moved an application before the Returning Officer on 24.1.2002 to cancel the nomination of the respondent No. 1 for wrongly showing himself as a member of scheduled caste, which he does nor, actually belong.""

4. A bare perusal of the documents contained in the aforementioned paragraphs would show that the appellant in effect or substance did not raise any material fact that the first respondent herein was not a member of the Scheduled Caste. Learned counsel appearing, on behalf of the appellant, however, submitted that the averments contained in ground No. 4 (ii) contains the requisite fact. The said paragraphs contains the grounds for getting aside the improper acceptance of the nomination papers filed by the first respondent and cannot be treated to be statements containing the requisite material facts, which, if proved, would entitle the appellant in obtaining the reliefs sought for. Furthermore, the said statements had been verified and purported to be based on the legal advise. It may be true that for improper verification of the material facts pleading in the election petition, the same cannot be dismissed at the threshold, but apart from the fact that the appellant herein did not move any application for revivification of the election petition, the averments contained in paragraph 4(ii) does not satisfy the requirement of Section 81(1) of the Representation of People Act, 1951 and in that view of the matter, the said plea is not available to the appellant.

5. For the aforesaid reason, we do, not find any merit in the appeal. It is, accordingly, dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.

1. By order dated 10.12.2013, we had issued the following directions:

2. The motor vehicles carrying ""high dignitaries"" specified by the Central Government and their counterparts specified by the State Government may be fitted with red lights but the red lights with or without flasher can be used only while the specified high dignitary is on duty and not otherwise.

3. The State Governments and Administration of Union Territories cannot enlarge the scope of the term ""high dignitaries"" beyond what is prescribed in clauses 'c' and 'd' of Notifications dated 11.1.2002 and 28.7.2005 issued by the Central Government. Therefore, they shall amend the relevant rules and notifications to bring them in tune with the 1989 Rules and notifications dated 11.1.2002 and 28.7.2002 issued by the Central Government. This exercise must be completed within a period of three months.

4. The men in uniform; operational agencies which require un-hindered access to the roads for performance of their duty; those engaged in emergency duties such as ambulance services, fire services, emergency maintenance etc. and police vehicles used as escorts or pilots or for law and order duties shall not be entitled to have red lights but lights of other colours, e.g., blue, white, multi-coloured etc.

5. No motor vehicles except those specified in Rule 119(3) of the 1989 Rules or similar provisions contained in the rules framed by the State Governments or the Administration of Union Territories shall be fitted with multi-toned horns giving a succession of different notes or with any other sound producing device giving an unduly harsh, shrill, loud or alarming noise.

6.

In the note submitted by the learned Solicitor General, it has been mentioned that Clause 51 of the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, 2012 contains a provision for imposition of enhanced penalty. That amendment is not shown to have been carried out so far. We hope and trust that the Legislature will make appropriate amendment and make provision for imposition of adequate penalty which may operate as deterrent against misuse of the provisions of the 1989 Act and the 1989 Rules generally and the provisions of Rules 108 and 119 in particular. The State Governments and the Administration of the Union Territories shall either amend the existing rules or frame appropriate rules for imposing deterrent penalty on the violators of the rules containing prohibition against the use of red lights and multi-toned horns or similar devices.""

S.B. Sinha, J.

1. Criteria for determining inter se seniority amongst the officers of Haryana Judicial Service: whether on the basis of merit in terms of the merit list or the date of joining, is the core question involved in this appeal which arises out of a Judgment and Order dated 18.8.1999 passed by the Punjab & Haryana High Court in C.W.P. No. 3713 of 1998 filed by the appellant herein.

2. The basic fact of the matter is not in dispute. Haryana Public Service Commission, respondent No. 3 herein issued an advertisement notifying 24 vacancies of Haryana Civil Services (Judicial Branch) on or about 16.8.1988. The break up of the said posts is as under:

(i) Vacancies for General Category : 9

(ii) Vacancies reserved for scheduled castes : 10

(including five vacancies which remained unfilled on account of non-availability of candidates belonging to sc Category in the competitive exam. Held in 1985-86) (Advertised 3rd time).

(iii) Vacancies reserved for ESM : 3

(iv) Vacancies reserved for Backward Classes : 2

3. A competitive examination was held in December, 1986. By a Memo dated 6.2.1989, the first respondent herein sent requisition for anticipated vacancies upto 31.12.1990; the break up of which is as under:

4. By order dated 27th July, 1989, the Commission recommended 21 names for 28 vacancies, the break up of which is as under:

5. The result of the said examination for recruitment of the HSC (Judicial) Branch was published in the Haryana Gazette on or about 15.9.1989: from a perusal whereof, it would appear that the appellant herein was placed at serial No. 33 whereas the respondent Nos. 8 to 11 were placed at serial Nos. 14, 15, 16 and 18 respectively. It is not in dispute that on or about 6.2.1989 it was notified that existing and notified vacancies would be increased by 4; as a result whereof a further reservation being one for Scheduled Castes candidates and 1 for Backward Class candidate and 2 for general candidates was made, the break up thereof is:

6. The break up of all the 28 vacancies was as follows:

7. In the result published by the Haryana Public Service Commission, 42 candidates were declared qualified in terms of the provisions of the 'Rules Relating to the Appointment of Subordinate Judges in the Haryana Civil Service (Judicial Branch), 1951' (hereinafter referred to as 'the Rules'). Out of the successful candidates, three persons, namely, Mr. Baljeet Singh, Mr. Gulab Singh and mr. Chaman Lal Mohal whose names figured at serial Nos. 27, 39 and 42 belonged to the Backward Classes. Five persons including the appellant herein, namely, Mr. Ram Singh, Mrs. Bimlesh Tanwar, Mr. Krishan Kumar, Mr. Ram Niwas Bharti and Mr. Jagdish Rai Duggal who were at serial Nos. 30, 33, 38, 40 and 41 of the Select List respectively belonged to Scheduled Castes and two persons, namely, Mr. Man Mohan Dhonchak and Mr. Chander Bhan were selected from the category of Ex-servicemen. 10 posts were, therefore, available for 17 posts reserved for different categories. According to the High Court, seven vacancies reserved for the members of Scheduled Castes and one for Ex-servicemen could be filled up from amongst the candidates belonging to the general category raising the number of posts available therefore to 18. However, despite the fact that 18 posts were available for members of the general category, for reasons best known to the State, only 8 persons belonging to the general category were appointed by an order dated 9.12.1989.

8. Respondents Nos. 9 and 10 thereafter with three other candidates who despite the fact that their names appeared in the merit list but were not appointed, filed a writ petition in the High Court contending inter alia therein that their names should have been entered in the register maintained therefore as envisaged by Rule 1 of Part-D of the Rules and to fill up the existing vacancies and also the vacancies, which are anticipated to raise during the period of 2 years from the date of publication of the result of the examination, i.e., up to December, 1991. The said writ petition was allowed by order dated 5.2.1991 holding:

""In terms of the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Neelima Shangla's case, MANU/SC/0472/1986MANU/SC/0472/1986 : [1986]3SCR785 , we direct the State of Haryana to forward the list of 42 candidates, who qualified in the examination (32 general and 10 reserved) held in December, 1988 and the High Court would forthwith enter the names of such number of candidates as would be necessary in terms of Rule 8 of Part-D of the Rules in the Register in order of merit. The names of the candidates of the reserved categories would also be brought on the Register in the same manner. The High Court would then consider to fill up the remaining vacancies and would forward the names of the requisite number of candidates to the State Government for appointment as per Rule 7(1) of Part D of the Rules as Subordinate Judges under Article 234 of the Constitution. While doing so it will be open to the High Court in the interests of higher standard not to recommend the names of all the candidates, who obtained 55 per cent marks and the appointment can be restricted to such number of candidates, who obtained higher percentage than 55 per cent as may be decided by the High Court and agreed to by the Government.""

9. It is not in dispute that this Court in Neelima Shangla v. State of Haryana and Ors. MANU/SC/0472/1986MANU/SC/0472/1986 : [1986]3SCR785 directed that she be assigned seniority with the 1984 Batch. The High Court's direction was made in the light of the observations of this Court in Neelima Shangla.

10. The High Court, on its administrative side thereafter by a letter dated 20.8.1991 requested the State to comply with the order passed by it on its judicial side and issue order for appointment in respect of Ms. Ritu Jhanji, S/Shri A.S. Narang and Kamal Kant, whose names as noticed hereinbefore, figured at serial Nos. 14, 15 and 16 of the merit list. The appointment letters of Mr. A.S. Narang and Kamal Kant were issued on 18.11.1991 whereas the appointment letter of Ms. Ritu was issued on 21.11.1992. As in the meantime, two more candidates, namely, Ms. Archna Soni (serial No. 13) and Mr. Kali Kishore Sharma (serial No. 17) expressed their unwillingness to join the said post, the State Government was requested for the appointment of Ms. Sarita Gupta (serial No. 18). A similar request was made by letter dated 14.10.1992 for appointment of Mrs. Manisha Chopra (now Manisha Batra), and S/Shri Satish Kumar Garg and Rajiv Tyagi whose names appeared at serial Nos. 19, 20 and 21 of merit list but the State refused to accede to the said recommendations. Aggrieved the said candidates filed writ petitions before the High Court which was marked as CWP Nos. 963/93, 5400/93, 5602/93 and 637/93. The writ petitions of Mr. Rajiv Tyagi and Ms. Manisha Chopra was allowed whereas the writ petition of Mr. Pramod Kumar was disposed of with a direction to the High Court to recommend his name under the Rules with a further direction that thereafter the State Government would appoint him forthwith. However, other two writ petitions were dismissed. On an appeal preferred against the said judgment by the 1st respondent herein in relation to the writ petition filed by Ms. Manisha Chopra, although special leave was granted by this Court but ultimately having regard to the undisputed factual position that there has been an existing vacancy, the said appeal was dismissed. However, the appeal in relation to Mr. Rajiv Tyagi and mr. Pramod Kumar being Civil Appeal Nos. 4426 and 4428 of 1994 were allowed. Pursuant to and in furtherance of the order of this Court, an offer of appointment was issued in favour of Ms. Manisha Batra on 7.11.1994.

11. Representations were made by the judicial officers for determination of their inter se seniority in the aforementioned premise and the matter was considered by a Sub-committee appointed by the High Court. The Sub-committee upon giving opportunities of hearing to all parties and or their lawyers opined that having regard to the consistent practice followed by the High Court that seniority be determined as per merit, the same rule should be made applicable and thus negatived the contention raised on behalf of the appellant and persons similarly situated that inter se seniority be determined on the basis of the respective dates of appointments of the candidates. While arriving at the said decision, the Sub-committee found that the cases of the concerned candidate is similar to that of Neelima Shangla.

12. The said recommendations of the Sub-committee were accepted by the Full Court of the High Court by adopting a resolution in that behalf on or about 17.7.1997. Aggrieved thereby, a writ petition was filed by the appellant herein which by reason of the impugned judgment was dismissed.

13. Before the High Court, only two contentions were raised on behalf of the appellant, namely: (1) that the vacancies, which remained unfilled because of non-availability of the candidates from the reserved category, i.e.. Schedule Castes category, could not have been diverted to general category candidates as the same could not have been dereserved and factually these very vacancies of the year 1989 which remained unfilled from the Scheduled Castes category were actually advertised in the year 1992 and, therefore, there were no posts vacant for the private respondents, who have been given appointments in the batch of year 1989 because of non-existence of posts in the general category; and (2) that even though the petitioner, who belongs to Scheduled Castes category may have been below the general category candidate in the merit list, yet the seniority is to be determined as per the roster points and not according to merit. Both the said contentions did not find favour with the High Court.

14. Dr. Krishan Singh Chauhan, learned counsel appearing for the appellant has raised a number of contentions in support of this appeal. The learned counsel contends that as nine posts were advertised for general categories, appointment of 18 persons there against was illegal. Reliance in this behalf has been placed on Ashok Kumar and Ors. v. Chairman, Banking Service Recruitment Board and Ors. MANU/SC/0258/1996MANU/SC/0258/1996 : (1996)ILLJ1103SC .

15. The learned counsel contended that the appellant herein would not question the legality or validity of the appointments of respondents Nos. 8 to 11 but submitted that no candidate from the waiting list appointed subsequently could be appointed from a back date. A person appointed pursuant to the order of the High Court, urged Dr. Chauhan, shall be deemed to be in service from the date he joins and not prior thereto. It was contended that having regard to the fact that vacancies in the reserved categories had to be filled up in accordance with the roster points, no general category candidate would have been appointed against such vacancies having regard to the decision of the apex Court in R.K. Sabharwal and Ors. v. State of Punjab and Ors. MANU/SC/0259/1995MANU/SC/0259/1995 : [1995]2SCR35 . The learned counsel would urge that the vacancies must be filled up as per roster points and this principle of law has been reiterated by a Constitution Bench if this in All India Judges' Association and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors..

16. Dr. Chauhan urged that having regard to the Amendment in the Constitution inserting Article 16(4A), the decision of this Court in Ajit Singh and Ors. (II) v. State of Punjab MANU/SC/0575/1999MANU/SC/0575/1999 : AIR1999SC3471 must be held to have lost its efficacy. Our attention has also been drawn to the opinion of the Commission that inter se seniority of the officers be determined on the basis of respective dates of appointment.

17. Mr. P.P. Rao, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of Appellant Nos. 8 to 11, on the other hand, submitted that having regard to the practice prevalent in the Punjab & Haryana High Court inter se seniority has rightly been determined on the basis of result of the examination conducted by the Public Service Commission. The learned counsel would urge that as this Court in Neelima Shangla (supra) while considering the question of appointment of a candidate under the said Rules directed that she be placed in the seniority list of 1984 Batch, there is no reason as to why this Court would deviate from the said principle.

18. Mr. Rao would urge that it is not within the province of the Commission to make recommendations as regards the inter se seniority of the candidates in as much as its function is merely to make recommendations for appointment of the candidates upon preparing a select list therefore.

19. It was submitted that having regard to the instructions issued by the Haryana Government in its Circular letter dated 27.4.1982, roster points cannot be considered a s seniority points and further having regard to the fact that these instructions have been followed by the High Court for a long time, there is absolutely no reason as to why such a practice should be deviated from. The learned counsel contended that this Court in Ajit Singh-(II) (supra) having categorically held that roster points are not intended to determine seniority between general candidates and reserved candidates, the impugned judgment cannot be faulted with.

20. It is not in dispute that the Rules are in force since 26. 10.1951. Part-A of the Rules lays down the qualifications for appointments. Part-B of the Rules provides that the advertisement to be issued for the post by Haryana Public Service Commission as also the mode and manner in which the applications are required to be submitted by the candidates. Part-C of the said Rules relates to the examination of the candidates. Rules 7 provides that ""no candidate shall be called for the viva-voce test unless he obtains at least 45 per cent marks in the aggregate in all the written papers and 33 per cent marks in the language paper of Hindi (in Devnagri Script).""

21. Rule 8 of the Rules is as under:

""No candidate shall be considered to have qualified in the examination unless he obtains atleast 55 per cent marks in the aggregate of all papers including the viva-voce test.

The merit of the qualified candidates shall be determined strictly according to the marks obtained by them;

Provided that in case two or more candidates obtain equal marks, their merit shall be determined according to the marks secured by them in viva-voce and if the marks in the viva-voce of the candidates are also equal the older in age shall be placed higher in order of merit.'

22. Rule 10 which is important for the purpose of determination of the matter read as under:

""(i) The result of the Examination will be published in the Punjab Government Gazette. (ii) Candidates will be selected for appointment strictly in the order in which they have been placed by the Punjab Service Commission in the list of those who have qualified under Rule 8.

Provided that in the case of candidates belonging to the Scheduled Castes/Tribes and other backward classes, Government will have a right to select in order of merit a candidate who has merely qualified under Rule 8, irrespective of the position obtained by him in the examination;

Provided further that the selection of candidates belonging to the Scheduled Castes/Tribes and other Backward Classes in the order of merit inter se shall be made against the vacancies reserved for them and in the manner prescribed by Government from time to time.""

Rules 1 and 8 or Part-D governing appointments read thus:

""1. The names of candidates selected by Government for appointment of Subordinate Judges under Rules 10 and 11 of Part-C shall be entered on the High Court register in the order of their selection.""

""2. There is no limit to the number of names borne on the High Court register but ordinarily no more names will be included than are estimated to be sufficient for the filling of vacancies which are anticipated to be likely to occur within two years from the date of selection of candidates as a result of an examination.""

23. The Rules, therefore, indisputably lay emphasis on merit. It for all intent and purport excludes the applicability of rule of appointment in terms of roster points.

24. It is not in dispute that despite absence of any specific rule relating to determining of inter se seniority, a long standing practice prevailing in the High Court has been that it be determined strictly on the basis of the order of merit. It is relevant to note that the State of Haryana had issued instructions on or about 27.4.1972, the relevant portions whereof are as under:

""It has come to the notice in the matter of fixing seniority, there has been misinterpretation of the relevant instructions in some instances and members of SCs/BCs been assigned seniority according the serial numbers of the vacancies reserved for them under the block system (as indicated below) and not as they should have according to the order of candidates determined by the Public Service Commission:-

Vacancies reserved for SCs/BCs in every block of 100 vacancies 1, 6, 11 ,24, 16,2 1, 26,27, 3 1-36, 41,46,56,61,66-71,76-77, 81, 86,91,96 (No. 27 and 77 for BCs.)

For example when 8 vacancies were to be filled and the 1st and the 6th were reserved for the members of SCs two schedule castes candidates were placed at Sl. No. 1 and serial No. 6 respectively in the combined seniority list of the candidates although the combined seniority list prepared by the PSC/SSSB their position were lower.

2. It has to be pointed out that this was irregular and inter se seniority of all the candidates taken together (i.e. whether appointed against reserved vacancies or against open ones), must be fixed according to the combined merit list and not otherwise. Vacancies assigned to SCs/BCs under the block system for the purpose of reservation only and are not intended for are not assigned fixing inter se seniority of the candidates contrary to their order in the combined merit list prepared by the PSC/SSSB.

3. This may please be noted for careful compliance so that in future seniority is fixed on this basis in case in which reserved vacancies are filled whether by initial appointment or by promotion. Furthermore, all earlier cases in which members or SCs/BCs and others have been assigned seniority erroneously in disregard of the order of candidates in the combined merit list should be reviewed and steps taken to refix seniority correctly. For that purposes, it will be necessary that the persons who will be affected should be given an opportunity of showing cause why their seniority should not be fixed at a lower place, in accordance with the order in the combined merit list such opportunity should be duly allowed before refixing seniority.""

25. The contesting parties herein had appeared in the same examination. It is also not in dispute that the results of the said examination were published by the Commissioner on 15.9.1989. The candidate who could be appointed from amongst the said list were for those vacancies which were existing on that date as also likely to occur upto September, 1991. In terms of the Rules, as referred to hereinbefore, their names had to be entered in the register. It was not so done. The right of the candidates who could be appointed in terms of the extant rules was ignored.

26. The interpretation of the Rules came up for consideration of this Court in Neelima Shangla v. State of Haryana MANU/SC/0472/1986MANU/SC/0472/1986 : [1986]3SCR785 . Having regard to the purport of the said Rules it was held:

""The names of the selected candidates are to be entered in a Register maintained by the High Court in the Order of their selection and appointment are to be made from the names entered in the Register in that order. The number of names to be entered in the Register maintained by the High Court may be sufficient to fill vacancies anticipated to occur within two years from the date of selection of candidate as a result of the examination. Therefore, it appears that the duty of the Public Service Commission in confined to holding the written examination, holding the viva voce test and arranging the order of merit according to marks among the candidates who have qualified as a result of the written and the viva voce tests. Thereafter, the Public Service Commission is required to publish the result in the gazette and apparently, to make the result available to the government. The Public Service Commission is not required to make further selection from the qualified candidates and is, therefore, not expected to withhold the names of any qualified candidates. The duty of the Public Service Commission is to make available to the government a complete list of qualified candidates arranged in order of merit. Thereafter, the government is to make the selection strictly in the order in which they have been placed by the Commission as a result of the examination. The names of the selected candidates are then to be entered in the Register maintained by the High Court strictly in that order and appointments made from the names entered in that Register also strictly in the same order. It is, of course, open to the government not to fill up all the vacancies for a valid reason.

27. It was clearly held that having regard to the Rules, it was incumbent on the part of the Commission to communicate the entire list of qualified candidates to the Government. It was held that the Commission was not concerned with the number of vacancies at all and as such it could not have been withheld the full list of successful candidates on the ground that only a limited number of vacancies are available. Taking note of the fact that like the present case, therein also the High Court had informed the Government that more vacancies were are required to be filled, it was observed:

""If the government had been aware that there were qualified candidates available, they would have surely applied Rule 8 of Part D and made the necessary selection to be communicated to the High Court. The net result is that qualified candidates, though available, were not selected and were not appointed. Miss Neelima Shangla is one of them. In the view that we have taken of the rules, Miss Neelima Shangla is entitled to be selected for appointment as Subordinate Judge in the Haryana Civil Service (Judicial Branch).""

28. In the aforementioned situation, this Court directed that the names of the petitioner them be included in the list of 1984 list of candidates.

29. As noticed hereinbefore, a bench of this Court in State of Haryana v. Rajiv Kumar C.A. Nos. 4426-28 of 1994 as noticed hereinbefore dismissed the special leave petition in respect of Ms. Manisha Batra (Now Ms. Manisha Chopra) holding that a clear vacancy existed.

30. We may further notice that a Division Bench of the Punjab & Haryana High Court in Kamal Kant and Ors. v. State of Haryana and Anr. [1991 (3) Recent Services Judgments] arising out of the same advertisement, directed:

""In terms of the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Neelima Shangla's case (supra), we direct the State of Haryana to forward the list of 42 candidates who qualified in the examination (32 general and 10 reserved) held in December, 1988 forthwith and the High Court would enter the names of such number of candidates as would be necessary in terms of Rule 8 of Part D of the Rules in the Register in order of merit. The names of the candidates of the reserved categories would also be brought on the Register in the same manner. The High Court would then consider to fill up the remaining vacancies and would forward the names of the requisite number of candidates to the State Government for appointment as per Rule 7(1) of Part D of the Rules as Subordinate Judges under Article 234 of the Constitution. While doing so it will be open to the High Court in the interests of higher standard not to recommend the names of all the candidates who obtained 55 per cent marks and the appointment can be restricted to such number of candidates who obtained higher percentage than (sic) per cent as may be decided by the High Court (sic) agreed to by the Government.""

31. In the aforementioned backdrop, the submission of Dr. Chauhan is required to be considered.

32. The question as to whether the determination of inter se seniority would depend upon the filling up of the vacancies so far as the reserved categories are concerned, having regard to the roster points in our opinion, is no longer res integra.

33. In Ajit Singh and Ors. (II) v. State of Punjab and Ors. MANU/SC/0575/1999MANU/SC/0575/1999 : AIR1999SC3471 a five Judge Bench of this Court has laid down the law in the following terms.

""It must be noted that whenever a reserved candidate goes for recruitment at the initial level (say Level 1) he is not going through the normal process of selection which is applied to a general candidate but get appointment to a post reserved for his group. That is what is meant by 'reservation'. That is the effect of ""reservation"".

Now in a case where the reserved candidate has not opted to (sic) on lus merit but has opted for the reserved post of a roster is set at Level 1 for promotion (sic) the reserved candidate at various roster points to Level 2, the reserved candidate, if he is otherwise at the end of the merit list, goes to Level 2 without competing with general candidates and he goes up by a large number of places. In a (sic) with 100 places, if the roster points are 8, (sic) 24 etc at each of these points the reserved candidate if he is at the end of the merit list, gets promotion to Level 2 by side-stepping several general candidates. That is the effect of the roster- point promotion.

It deserves to be noticed that the roster points fixed at Level 1 are not intended to determine any seniority at Level 1 between general candidates and the reserved candidates. This aspect we shall consider again when we come to Mervyn Continho v. Collector of Customs MANU/SC/0230/1966MANU/SC/0230/1966 : (1967)ILLJ749SC lower down. The roster point merely becomes operative whenever a vacancy reserved at Level 2 becomes available. Once such vacancies are all filled, the roster has worked itself out. Thereafter other reserved candidates can be promoted only when a vacancy at the reserved points already filled arises. That was what was decided in R.K. Sabharwal v. State of Punjab MANU/SC/0259/1995MANU/SC/0259/1995 : [1995]2SCR35 .""

34. In Ajit Singh (II), the decision of this Court in R.K. Sabharwal case has, thus, been explained.

35. P.S. (sic) v. State of Haryana and Ors. MANU/SC/0091/1996MANU/SC/0091/1996 : AIR1996SC351 relied upon by Dr. Chauhan, is a decision rendered by a two Judge bench. In that case Rule 13 of the Rules envisaged that the seniority inter se of members of the service shall be determined by the length of continuous service on any post in the service; provided further that in the case of two or more members appointed by direct recruitment, the order of merit determined by the Commission shall not be disturbed in fixing the seniority. Despite the said Rule, it was held:

""Take for instance Vacancies Nos. 1 and 6, as pointed out in the Chief Secretary's letter have admittedly been reserved for Scheduled Castes. Suppose recruitment was made to fill up ten vacancies, three candidates from Scheduled Castes were selected on the basis of reserved quota. The question is whether the first candidate will be put in the quota allotted to the Scheduled Castes in the roster. Having been selected as a general candidate, though he is more meritorious than the second and third candidates, he will not get the placement in the roster, reserved for Scheduled Castes i.e. Nos. 1 and 6 points. Consequently candidates Nos. 2 and 3 will get the placement at Nos. 1 and 6 and the first candidate will get the placement in the order of merit along with the general candidates according to the order of merit maintained by the Selection Committee or the Public Service Commission. He cannot complain that having been selected in the merit, he must be placed in the placement reserved for Scheduled Castes at Point No. 1 in the roster. Equally, though general candidate is more meritorious in the order of merit prepared by the Public Service Commission or the Selection Committee, when the appointments are made and the vacancies are filled up according to the roster, necessarily and inevitably the reserved candidates though less meritorious in the order of merit maintained by the Public Service Commission would occupy the respective places assigned in the roster. Thereby they steal a march over some of the general candidates and get seniority over the general candidates. This scheme is, therefore, constitutional, valid and is not arbitrary.""

36. We have not been able to persuade ourselves to the aforesaid view.

37. In A.I.I.M.S. Students Union v. A.I.I.M.S. and Ors. MANU/SC/0480/2001MANU/SC/0480/2001 : AIR2001SC3262 , his Court observed:

""Reservation, as an exception, may be justified subject to discharging the burden of proving justification in favour of the class which must be educationally handicapped - the reservation geared up to getting over the handicap. The rationale of reservation in the case of medical students must be removal of regional or class inadequacy or like disadvantage. Even there the quantum of reservation should not be excessive or societally injurious. The higher the level of the speciality the lesser the role of reservation.

Any reservation apart from being sustainable on the constitutional anvil, must also be reasonable to be permissible. In assessing the reasonability one of the factors to be taken into consideration would be whether the character and quantum of reservation would stall or accelerate achieving the ultimate goal of excellence enabling the National constantly rising to higher levels. In the era of globalisation, where the nation as a whole has to compete with other nations of the world so as to survive, excellence cannot be given an unreasonable go by and certainly not compromised in its entirety. Fundamental duties, though not enforceable by a writ of the Court, yet provide a valuable guide and aid to interpretation of Constitutional and legal issues. In case of doubt or choice, people's wish as manifested through Article 51-A can serve as a guide not only for resolving the issue but also for constructing or moulding the relief to be given by the Courts.""

38. In K. Duraisamy and Anr. v. State of T.N. and Ors., MANU/SC/0044/2001MANU/SC/0044/2001 : [2001]1SCR489 , this Court held:

""The mere use of the word reservation per se does not have the consequence of ipso facto applying the entire mechanism underlying the constitutional concept of a protective reservation specially designed for the advancement of any socially-and-educationally-backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, to enable them to enter and adequately represent in various fields. The meaning, content and purport of the expression will necessarily depend upon the purpose and object with which it (sic) used.""

39. An affirmative action in terms of Article 16(4) of the Constitution is meant for providing a representation of class of citizenry who are socially or economically backward. Article 16 of the Constitution of India is applicable in the case of an appointment. It does not speak of fixation of seniority. Seniority is, thus, not to be fixed in terms of the roster points. If that is done, the rule of affirmative action would be extended which would strictly not be in consonance of the constitutional schemes. We are of the opinion that the decision in P.S. Ghalaut does not lay down a good law.

40. In All India Judges Association's case, this Court was considering the matter relating to implementation of recommendations of Shetty's Commission as regard the fixation of pay scales of the Judicial officers. This Court noticed that sometimes merit suffers because of seniority. It was directed:

""We direct 'that recruitment to the Higher Judicial Service, i.e., the cadre of District Judges will be:

(1)(a) 50 per cent by promotion from amongst the Civil Judges (Senior Division) on the basis of principle of merit-cum-seniority and passing a suitability test:

(b) 25 per cent by promotion strictly on the basis of merit through limited competitive examination of Civil Judges (Senior Division) having not less than five years' qualifying service; and

(c) 25 per cent of the posts shall be filled by direct recruitment from amongst the eligible advocates on the ba"
"

A.K. Sikri, J.

1. The parties to this lis, who are brothers, had entered into a deed of partnership dated 01.04.1994 for carrying on hotel business and this partnership firm has been running a hotel with the name 'Hotel Arunagiri' located at Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu. Some disputes arose out of the said partnership deed between the parties. Partnership Deed contains an arbitration Clause i.e. Clause (8) which stipulates resolution of disputes by means of arbitration.

2. Notwithstanding the same, the Respondents herein have filed a civil suit before the Court of Ist Additional District Munsif Court, Tirunelveli, Madurai (Tamil Nadu) seeking a declaration that as partners they are entitled to participate in the administration of the said hotel. Relief of permanent injunction restraining the Defendant (Appellant herein) from interfering with their right to participate in the administration of the hotel has also been sought. This suit was filed in the year 2012. The Appellant, after receiving the summons in the said suit, moved the application Under Section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act') raising an objection to the maintainability of the suit in view of arbitration agreement between the parties as contained in Clause (8) of the Partnership Deed dated 01.04.1994 and submitted that as per the provisions of Section 8 of the Act, it is mandatory for the Court to refer the dispute to the arbitrator. This application was resisted by the Respondents with the submission that since acts of fraud were attributed to the Appellant by the Plaintiffs/Respondents, such serious allegations of fraud could not be adjudicated upon by the Arbitral Tribunal and the appropriate remedy was to approach the civil court by filing a suit, and that was exactly done by the Respondents. For this purpose, the Respondents had relied upon the judgment of this Court in the case of N. Radhakrishnan v. Maestro Engineers and Ors. MANU/SC/1758/2009MANU/SC/1758/2009 : (2010) 1 SCC 72. This plea of the Respondents was sought to be controverted by the Appellant by arguing that aforesaid judgment was found to be per incuriam by this Court in Swiss Timing Ltd. v. Commonwealth Games 2010 Organising Committee MANU/SC/0516/2014MANU/SC/0516/2014 : (2014) 6 SCC 677, wherein the application Under Section 11 of the Act was allowed holding that such a plea of fraud can be adequately taken care of even by the arbitrator. It was, thus, argued that the parties were bound by the arbitration agreement and there was no reason to file the civil suit. The trial court, however, dismissed the application of the Appellant herein by its order dated 25.04.2014, relying upon the judgment in N. Radhakrishnan.

3. Feeling aggrieved by this order, the Appellant preferred revision petition before the High Court repeating his contention that judgment in N. Radhakrishnan was held to be per incuriam and, therefore, trial court had committed jurisdictional error in rejecting the application of the Appellant Under Section 8 of the Act. Brushing aside this plea, the High Court has also chosen to go by the dicta laid down in N. Radhakrishnan with the observations that Swiss Timing Ltd. is the order passed by a single Judge of this Court Under Section 11 of the Act whereas judgment in N. Radhakrishnan is rendered by a Division Bench of two Hon. Judges of this Court, which is binding on the High Court.

Whether the aforesaid view of the High Court in following the dicta laid down in the case of N. Radhakrishnan, in the facts of this case, is correct or not, is the question that needs determination in the instant appeal.

4. Seminal facts in the context in which the issue falls for determination have already been taken note of above. However, few more facts need to be added to the aforesaid chronology, particularly, the nature of plea of fraud taken in the suit filed by the Respondents.

The Respondents are four in number who are brothers of the Appellant. These five brothers are the partners. Their father A. Arunagiri was also a partner along with them who died on 28.04.2009. These six partners had 1/6th share each in the partnership business. Disputes arose between the brothers after the demise of their father. It is the allegation of the Respondents, as contained in the plaint, that the subject matter of the suit 'Hotel Arunagiri' was managed and administered by their father in a disciplined manner till his death. After his death, the Appellant being the eldest brother wanted to take the administration of 'Hotel Arunagiri' with the assurance that he will be following the foot prints of his father. The Respondents had no other alternative except to accept the said proposal in good faith. It was, at that time resolved by all the brothers, that the daily collection of money from 'Hotel Arunagiri' should be deposited on the very next day into the hotel Current Account No. 23 maintained with the Indian Overseas Bank, Tirunelveli Junction. It was agreed that about rupees ten to fifteen thousand may be kept as cash for urgent expenses. The Respondents reposed confidence with the Appellant and believed that his administration would never be detrimental to the smooth running of the business. On the aforesaid understanding, administration of the hotel was taken over by the Appellant. But he did not adhere to the said understanding and failed to deposit day to day collection into the bank account as promised. It is also alleged that the Appellant, fraudulently, signed and issued a cheque for Rs. 10,00,050/- dated 17.06.2010 from the bank account in the name of 'Hotel Arunagiri' in favour of his son without the knowledge and consent of the other partners and in this manner, the money was siphoned off and misappropriated from the common fund. It is further alleged that the Appellant kept the hotel account books with him and did not show it to the Respondents for their examination. The Respondents sent legal notices but it did not deter the Appellant to continue to act in the same manner by not depositing the day to day collections in the account. It is also alleged that Appellant's wife's younger brother one Dhanapalraj was a member of Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and was also a Vice-Chairman of All India Bar Council, New Delhi. In Chennai, the Central Bureau of Investigation (C.B.I.) raided the houses of the said Dhanapalraj and his co-brother Chandrasekaran and seized Rs. 45,00,000/- cash from them. As Dhanapalraj was aware of the disputes between the Appellant and the Respondents in respect of the 'Hotel Arunagiri', a false statement has been given by him before C.B.I. to the effect that the seized money of Rs. 45 lakhs belonged to 'Hotel Arunagiri'. It is reliably learned that the Appellant had also, on receipt of summons, appeared before the C.B.I. in New Delhi and given a false statement as if the said seized money of Rs. 45 lakhs belonged to 'Hotel Arunagiri' which was taken to Chennai to purchase a property. This led to the issuance of another notice dated 22.01.2011 by the third Respondent to the Appellant stating that the money seized by the C.B.I. belong only to Dhanpalaraj and not 'Hotel Arunagiri'. On the basis of the aforesaid allegations, which are relevant and material for the purposes of this appeal, following reliefs are sought in the suit filed by the Respondents:

(a) for a declaration that the Respondents as partners of the deed of partnership dated 01.04.1994 are entitled to participate in the administration of the Hotel Arunagiri mentioned in the Schedule and for consequential permanent injunction restraining the Appellant from interfering with the same;

(b) for cost of this suit; and

(c) for such other reliefs this Honourable Court deem fit and proper in the circumstances of this case.

5. As already mentioned above, the Appellant filed the application Under Section 8 of the Act for rejection of the plaint and reference of the dispute to an arbitrator in which attempt the Appellant has not succeeded for the reasons stated hereinabove.

6. The two courts below have preferred to adopt the dicta laid down in N. Radhakrishnan while dismissing the application of the Appellant Under Section 8 of the Act holding that as there are serious allegations as to fraud and malpractices committed by the Appellant in respect of the finances of the partnership firm and the case does not warrant to be tried and decided by the arbitrator and a civil court would be more competent which has the requisite means to decide such complicated matter. In this backdrop, it would be appropriate to revisit the law on this aspect before adverting to the question as to whether the approach of the High Court was correct in following the judgment in N. Radhakrishnan in the instant case.

7. In this behalf, we have to begin our discussion with the pertinent observation that insofar as the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 is concerned, it does not make any specific provision excluding any category of disputes terming them to be non-arbitrable. Number of pronouncements have been rendered laying down the scope of judicial intervention, in cases where there is an arbitration clause, with clear and unambiguous message that in such an event judicial intervention would be very limited and minimal. However, the Act contains provisions for challenging the arbitral awards. These provisions are Section 34 and Section 48 of the Act. Section 34(2)(b) and Section 48(2) of the Act, inter alia, provide that an arbitral award may be set aside if the Court finds that the 'subject matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law for the time being in force.' Even when such a provision is interpreted, what is to be shown is that there is a law which makes subject matter of a dispute incapable of settlement by arbitration. The aforesaid position in law has been culled out from the combined readings of Sections 5, 16 and 34 of the Act. When arbitration proceedings are triggered by one of the parties because of the existence of an arbitration agreement between them, Section 5 of the Act, by a non-obstante clause, provides a clear message that there should not be any judicial intervention at that stage scuttling the arbitration proceedings. Even if the other party has objection to initiation of such arbitration proceedings on the ground that there is no arbitration agreement or validity of the arbitration Clause or the competence of the Arbitral Tribunal is challenged, Section 16, in clear terms, stipulates that such objections are to be raised before the Arbitral Tribunal itself which is to decide, in the first instance, whether there is any substance in questioning the validity of the arbitration proceedings on any of the aforesaid grounds. It follows that the party is not allowed to rush to the Court for an adjudication. Even after the Arbitral Tribunal Rules on its jurisdiction and decides that arbitration Clause is valid or the Arbitral Tribunal is legally constituted, the aggrieved party has to wait till the final award is pronounced and only at that stage the aggrieved party is allowed to raise such objection before the Court in proceedings Under Section 34 of the Act while challenging the arbitral award. The aforesaid scheme of the Act is succinctly brought out in the following discussion by this Court in Kvaerner Cementation India Ltd. v. Bajranglal Agarwal and Anr. (2012) 5 SCC 214:

3. There cannot be any dispute that in the absence of any arbitration Clause in the agreement, no dispute could be referred for arbitration to an Arbitral Tribunal. But, bearing in mind the very object with which the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 has been enacted and the provisions thereof contained in Section 16 conferring the power on the Arbitral Tribunal to Rule on its own jurisdiction, including ruling on any objection with respect to existence or validity of the arbitration agreement, we have no doubt in our mind that the civil court cannot have jurisdiction to go into that question.

4. A bare reading of Section 16 makes it explicitly clear that the Arbitral Tribunal has the power to Rule on its own jurisdiction even when any objection with respect to existence or validity of the arbitration agreement is raised, and a conjoint reading of Sub-sections (2), (4) and (6) of Section 16 would make it clear that such a decision would be amenable to be assailed within the ambit of Section 34 of the Act.

5. In this view of the matter, we see no infirmity in the impugned order so as to be interfered with by this Court. The Petitioner, who is a party to the arbitral proceedings may raise the question of jurisdiction of the arbitrator as well as the objection on the ground of non-existence of any arbitration agreement in the so-called dispute in question, and on such an objection being raised, the arbitrator would do well in disposing of the same as a preliminary issue so that it may not be necessary to go into the entire gamut of arbitration proceedings.

Aforesaid is the position when Arbitral Tribunal is constituted at the instance of one of the parties and other party takes up the position that such proceedings are not valid in law.

8. What would be the position in case a suit is filed by the Plaintiff and in the said suit the Defendant files an application Under Section 8 of the Act questioning the maintainability of the suit on the ground that parties had agreed to settle the disputes through the means of arbitration having regard to the existence of an arbitration agreement between them?

Obviously, in such a case, the Court is to pronounce upon arbitrability or non-arbitrability of the disputes.

9. In the instant case, there is no dispute about the arbitration agreement inasmuch as there is a specific arbitration Clause in the partnership deed. However, the question is as to whether the dispute raised by the Respondent in the suit is incapable of settlement through arbitration. As pointed out above, the Act does not make any provision excluding any category of disputes treating them as non-arbitrable. Notwithstanding the above, the Courts have held that certain kinds of disputes may not be capable of adjudication through the means of arbitration. The Courts have held that certain disputes like criminal offences of a public nature, disputes arising out of illegal agreements and disputes relating to status, such as divorce, cannot be referred to arbitration. Following categories of disputes are generally treated as non-arbitrable1:

(i) patent, trademarks and copyright;

(ii) anti-trust/competition laws;

(iii) insolvency/winding up;

(iv) bribery/corruption;

(v) fraud;

(vi) criminal matters.

Fraud is one such category spelled out by the decisions of this Court where disputes would be considered as non-arbitrable.

10. 'Fraud' is a knowing misrepresentation of the truth or concealment of a material fact to induce another to act to his detriment. Fraud can be of different forms and hues. Its ingredients are an intention to deceive, use of unfair means, deliberate concealment of material facts, or abuse of position of confidence. The Black's Law Dictionary defines 'fraud' as a concealment or false representation through a statement or conduct that injures another who relies on it2. However, the moot question here which has to be addressed would be as to whether mere allegation of fraud by one party against the other would be sufficient to exclude the subject matter of dispute from arbitration and decision thereof necessary by the civil court.

11. In Abdul Kadir Shamsuddin Bubere v. Madhav Prabhakar Oak MANU/SC/0363/1961MANU/SC/0363/1961 : AIR 1962 SC 406, serious allegations of fraud were held by the Court to be a sufficient ground for not making a reference to arbitration. Reliance in that regard was placed by the Court on a decision of the Chancery Division in Russell v. Russell (1880) 14 Ch D 471. That was a case where a notice for the dissolution of a partnership was issued by one of the partners, upon which the other partner brought an action alleging various charges of fraud, and sought a declaration that the notice of dissolution was void. The partner who was charged with fraud sought reference of the disputes to arbitration. The Court held that in a case where fraud is charged, the Court will in general refuse to send the dispute to arbitration. But where the objection to arbitration is by a party charging the fraud, the Court will not necessarily accede to it and would never do so unless a prima facie case of fraud is proved.

12. The aforesaid judgment was followed by this Court in N. Radhakrishnan while considering the matter under the present Act. In that case, the Respondent had instituted a suit against the Appellant, upon which the Appellant filed an application Under Section 8 of the Act. The applicant made serious allegations against the Respondents of having committed malpractices in the account books, and manipulation of the finances of the partnership firm. This Court held that such a case cannot be properly dealt with by the arbitrator, and ought to be settled by the Court, through detailed evidence led by both parties.

13. When the case involves serious allegations of fraud, the dicta contained in the aforesaid judgments would be understandable. However, at the same time, mere allegation of fraud in the pleadings by one party against the other cannot be a ground to hold that the matter is incapable of settlement by arbitration and should be decided by the civil court. The allegations of fraud should be such that not only these allegations are serious that in normal course these may even constitute criminal offence, they are also complex in nature and the decision on these issues demand extensive evidence for which civil court should appear to be more appropriate forum than the Arbitral Tribunal. Otherwise, it may become a convenient mode of avoiding the process of arbitration by simply using the device of making allegations of fraud and pleading that issue of fraud needs to be decided by the civil court. The judgment in N. Radhakrishnan does not touch upon this aspect and said decision is rendered after finding that allegations of fraud were of serious nature.

14. As noted above, in Swiss Timing Ltd. case, single Judge of this Court while dealing with the same issue in an application Under Section 11 of the Act treated the judgment in N. Radhakrishnan as per incuriam by referring to the other judgments in the case of P. Anand Gajapathi Raju v. P.V.G. Raju MANU/SC/0281/2000MANU/SC/0281/2000 : (2000) 4 SCC 539 and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation. Ltd. v. Pinkcity Midway Petroleums MANU/SC/0482/2003MANU/SC/0482/2003 : (2003) 6 SCC 503. Two reasons were given in support which can be found in para 21 of the judgment which makes the following reading:

21. This judgment was not even brought to the note of the Court in N. Radhakrishnan's case. In my opinion, judgment in N. Radhakrishnan's case is per incuriam on two grounds; Firstly, the judgment in Hindustan Petroleum Corpn. Ltd., though referred has not been distinguished but at the same time is not followed also. The judgment in P. Anand Gajapathi Raju and Ors. Was not even brought to the notice of this Court. Therefore, the same has neither been followed nor considered. Secondly, the provision contained in Section 16 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 were also not brought to the notice by this Court. Therefore, in my opinion, the judgment in N. Radhakrishnan does not lay down the correct law and cannot be relied upon.

15. We shall revert to the question of per incuriam at a later stage. At this juncture, we may point out that the issue has been revisited by another Division Bench of this Court in Booz Allen and Hamilton Inc. v. SBI Home Finance Limited and Ors. MANU/SC/0533/2011MANU/SC/0533/2011 : (2011) 5 SCC 532. In this case, one of the questions that had arisen for determination was, in the context of Section 8 of the Act, as to whether the subject matter of the suit was 'arbitrable' i.e. capable of being adjudicated by a private forum (Arbitral Tribunal). In this context, the Court carried out detailed discussion on the term 'arbitrability' by pointing out three facets thereof, viz.:

1) whether the disputes are capable of adjudication and settlement by arbitration?

2) whether the disputes are covered by the arbitration agreement?

3) whether the parties have referred the disputes to arbitration?

16. As we are concerned with the first facet of the arbitrability of dispute, on this aspect the Court pointed out that in those cases where the subject matter falls exclusively within the domain of public fora, viz. the Courts, such disputes would be non-arbitrable and cannot be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal but by the Courts alone. The justification and rationale given for adjudicating such disputes through the process of Courts, i.e. public fora, and not by Arbitral Tribunals, which is a private forum, is given by the court in the following manner:

35. The Arbitral Tribunals are private fora chosen voluntarily by the parties to the dispute, to adjudicate their disputes in place of courts and tribunals which are public fora constituted under the laws of the country. Every civil or commercial dispute, either contractual or non-contractual, which can be decided by a court, is in principle capable of being adjudicated and resolved by arbitration unless the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunals is excluded either expressly or by necessary implication. Adjudication of certain categories of proceedings are reserved by the legislature exclusively for public fora as a matter of public policy. Certain other categories of cases, though not expressly reserved for adjudication by public fora (courts and tribunals), may by necessary implication stand excluded from the purview of private fora. Consequently, where the cause/dispute is in arbitrable, the court where a suit is pending, will refuse to refer the parties to arbitration, Under Section 8 of the Act, even if the parties might have agreed upon arbitration as the forum for settlement of such disputes.

36. The well-recognised examples of non-arbitrable disputes are: (i) disputes relating to rights and liabilities which give rise to or arise out of criminal offences; (ii) matrimonial disputes relating to divorce, judicial separation, restitution of conjugal rights, child custody; (iii) guardianship matters; (iv) insolvency and winding-up matters; (v) testamentary matters (grant of probate, letters of administration and succession certificate); and (vi) eviction or tenancy matters governed by special statutes where the tenant enjoys statutory protection against eviction and only the specified courts are conferred jurisdiction to grant eviction or decide the disputes.

37. It may be noticed that the cases referred to above relate to actions in rem. A right in rem is a right exercisable against the world at large, as contrasted from a right in personam which is an interest protected solely against specific individuals. Actions in personam refer to actions determining the rights and interests of the parties themselves in the subject-matter of the case, whereas actions in rem refer to actions determining the title to property and the rights of the parties, not merely among themselves but also against all persons at any time claiming an interest in that property. Correspondingly, a judgment in personam refers to a judgment against a person as distinguished from a judgment against a thing, right or status and a judgment in rem refers to a judgment that determines the status or condition of property which operates directly on the property itself. (Vide Black's Law Dictionary.)

38. Generally and traditionally all disputes relating to rights in personam are considered to be amenable to arbitration; and all disputes relating to rights in rem are required to be adjudicated by courts and public tribunals, being unsuited for private arbitration. This is not however a rigid or inflexible rule. Disputes relating to subordinate rights in personam arising from rights in rem have always been considered to be arbitrable.

17. The Law Commission has taken note of the fact that there is divergence of views between the different High Courts where two views have been expressed, one is in favor of the civil court having jurisdiction in cases of serious fraud and the other view encompasses that even in cases of serious fraud, the Arbitral Tribunal will Rule on its own jurisdiction. It may be pertinent here to reproduce the observations of the Law Commission as contained in paragraphs 50 & 51 of the 246th Law Commission Report, which are as under:

50. The issue of arbitrability of fraud has arisen on numerous occasions and there exist conflicting decisions of the Apex Court on this issue. While it has been held in Bharat Rasiklal v. Gautam Rasiklal MANU/SC/0978/2011MANU/SC/0978/2011 : (2012) 2 SCC 144 that when fraud is of such a nature that it vitiates the arbitration agreement, it is for the Court to decide on the validity of the arbitration agreement by determining the issue of fraud, there exists two parallel lines of judgments on the issue of whether an issue of fraud is arbitrable. In this context, a 2 judge bench of the Supreme Court, while adjudicating on an application Under Section 8 of the Act, in Radhakrishnan v. Maestro Engineers MANU/SC/1758/2009MANU/SC/1758/2009 : 2010 1 SCC 72 held that an issue of 28 fraud is not arbitrable. This decision was ostensibly based on the decision of the three judge bench of the Supreme Court in Abdul Qadir v. Madhav Prabhakar MANU/SC/0363/1961MANU/SC/0363/1961 : AIR 1962 SC 406. However, the said 3 judge bench decision (which was based on the finding in Russel v. Russel [1880 14 Ch.D. 471]) is only an authority for the proposition that a party against whom an allegation of fraud is made in a public forum, has a right to defend himself in that public forum. Yet, following Radhakrishnan, it appears that issues of fraud are not arbitrable.

51. A distinction has also been made by certain High Courts between a serious issue of fraud and a mere allegation of fraud and the former has been held to be not arbitrable (See Ivory Properties and Hotels Private Ltd. v. Nusli Neville Wadia MANU/MH/0028/2011MANU/MH/0028/2011 : 2011 (2) Arb LR 479 (Bom); C.S. Ravishankar v. C.K. Ravishankar MANU/KA/1302/2011MANU/KA/1302/2011 : 2011 (6) Kar LJ 417). The Supreme Court in Meguin GMBH v. Nandan Petrochem Ltd. 2007 (5) R.A.J. 239 (SC), in the context of an application filed Under Section 11 has gone ahead and appointed an arbitrator even though issues of fraud were involved. Recently, the Supreme Court in its judgment in Swiss Timing Ltd. v. Organising Committee, Arb. Pet. No. 34/2013 dated 28.05.2014, in a similar case of exercising jurisdiction Under Section 11, held that the judgment in Radhakrishnan is per incuriam and, therefore, not good law.

18. A perusal of the aforesaid two paragraphs brings into fore that the Law Commission has recognized that in cases of serious fraud, courts have entertained civil suits. Secondly, it has tried to make a distinction in cases where there are allegations of serious fraud and fraud simplicitor. It, thus, follows that those cases where there are serious allegations of fraud, they are to be treated as non-arbitrable and it is only the civil court which should decide such matters. However, where there are allegations of fraud simplicitor and such allegations are merely alleged, we are of the opinion it may not be necessary to nullify the effect of the arbitration agreement between the parties as such issues can be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal.

19. Before we apply the aforesaid test to the facts of the present case, a word on the observations in Swiss Timing Ltd.'s case to the effect that judgment of N. Radhakrishnan was per incuriam, is warranted. In fact, we do not have to labour on this aspect as this task is already undertaken by this Court in State of West Bengal and Ors. v. Associated Contractors MANU/SC/0793/2014MANU/SC/0793/2014 : (2015) 1 SCC 32. It has been clarified in the aforesaid case that Swiss Timings Ltd. was a judgment rendered while dealing with Section 11(6) of the Act and Section 11 essentially confers power on the Chief Judge of India or the Chief Justice of the High Court as a designate to appoint an arbitrator, which power has been exercised by another Hon'ble Judge as a delegate of the Chief Justice. This power of appointment of an arbitrator Under Section 11 by the Court, notwithstanding the fact that it has been held in SBP and Co. v. Patel Engineering Ltd. and Anr. MANU/SC/1787/2005MANU/SC/1787/2005 : (2005) 8 SCC 618 as a judicial power, cannot be deemed to have precedential value and, therefore, it cannot be deemed to have overruled the proposition of law laid down in N. Radhakrishnan.

20. In view of our aforesaid discussions, we are of the opinion that mere allegation of fraud simplicitor may not be a ground to nullify the effect of arbitration agreement between the parties. It is only in those cases where the Court, while dealing with Section 8 of the Act, finds that there are very serious allegations of fraud which make a virtual case of criminal offence or where allegations of fraud are so complicated that it becomes absolutely essential that such complex issues can be decided only by civil court on the appreciation of the voluminous evidence that needs to be produced, the Court can sidetrack the agreement by dismissing application Under Section 8 and proceed with the suit on merits. It can be so done also in those cases where there are serious allegations of forgery/fabrication of documents in support of the plea of fraud or where fraud is alleged against the arbitration provision itself or is of such a nature that permeates the entire contract, including the agreement to arbitrate, meaning thereby in those cases where fraud goes to the validity of the contract itself of the entire contract which contains the arbitration Clause or the validity of the arbitration Clause itself. Reverse position thereof would be that where there are simple allegations of fraud touching upon the internal affairs of the party inter se and it has no implication in the public domain, the arbitration Clause need not be avoided and the parties can be relegated to arbitration. While dealing with such an issue in an application Under Section 8 of the Act, the focus of the Court has to be on the question as to whether jurisdiction of the Court has been ousted instead of focusing on the issue as to whether the Court has jurisdiction or not. It has to be kept in mind that insofar as the statutory scheme of the Act is concerned, it does not specifically exclude any category of cases as non-arbitrable. Such categories of non-arbitrable subjects are carved out by the Courts, keeping in mind the principle of common law that certain disputes which are of public nature, etc. are not capable of adjudication and settlement by arbitration and for resolution of such disputes, Courts, i.e. public for a, are better suited than a private forum of arbitration. Therefore, the inquiry of the Court, while dealing with an application Under Section 8 of the Act, should be on the aforesaid aspect, viz. whether the nature of dispute is such that it cannot be referred to arbitration, even if there is an arbitration agreement between the parties. When the case of fraud is set up by one of the parties and on that basis that party wants to wriggle out of that arbitration agreement, a strict and meticulous inquiry into the allegations of fraud is needed and only when the Court is satisfied that the allegations are of serious and complicated nature that it would be more appropriate for the Court to deal with the subject matter rather than relegating the parties to arbitration, then alone such an application Under Section 8 should be rejected.

21. When we apply the aforesaid principles to the facts of this case, we find that the only allegation of fraud that is levelled is that the Appellant had signed and issued a cheque of Rs. 10,00,050/- dated 17.06.2010 of 'Hotel Arunagiri' in favour of his son without the knowledge and consent of the other partners i.e. the Respondents. It is a mere matter of accounts which can be looked into and found out even by the arbitrator. It does not involve any complex issue. If such a cheque is issued from the hotel account by the Appellant in favour of his son, it is easy to prove the same and then the onus is upon the Appellant to show as to what was the reason for giving that amount from"

M.B. Shah, J.

1. Leave granted.

2. Question involved in this appeal is -- whether one time payment of compensation to a poor agriculturist would be sufficient to meet the future medical expenses? It is true that lump-sum compensation contemplating future eventualities can be granted but at the same time -- Is it permissible under the Act to grant recurring medical expenses to such a victim? Secondly, whether amendment to the claim petition could be granted at the appellate stage?

3. Before we deal with this question, we would narrate a few facts. The appellant, a poor agriculturist, along with some other persons was travelling in a bullock cart on 6.2.1985 which met with an accident with a truck as a result of which he suffered injuries including the injury on right foot and right ankle exposing soft tissues and bones which was subsequently required to be amputated. Other persons also sustained injuries and the bullock cart was also damaged. The appellant, alongwith other injured persons, filed claim application bearing MVC No. 321 of 1985 before the Claims Tribunal, Chitradurga. The Tribunal passed an award dated 26.3.1990 granting a sum of Rs. 15,000/- for injury, pain and suffering, Rs. 5000/- for loss of enjoyment of life and Rs. 5000/- for loss of earnings and Rs. 5000/- for medical treatment, totaling Rs. 30,000/- with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of application. Against that award, appellant preferred MFA No. 2237/90 before the High Court of Karnataka at Bangalore. The High Court enhanced the compensation and awarded Rs. 82,000/- towards the loss of amenities of life, loss of future earnings, pain and sufferings. Apart from this sum, it was ordered that the appellant shall be entitled to a further sum of Rs. 18000/- for purchase of artificial leg. It has come on record that the appellant was an agriculturist and that according to the medical evidence, he had suffered 80 to 85 per cent permanent disability. The medical evidence further reveals that his right leg was amputated and he was required to change the artificial leg once in 2 to 3 years.

4. Before we deal with the question of compensation, we would refer to second contention which is raised in this appeal.

Amendment to the Claim Petition claiming enhanced compensation:-

5. At the time of hearing of this matter, learned counsel for the appellant has filed an application seeking permission to amend the claim petition and for enhancement of claim to the tune of Rs. 5 lacs as compensation. Before the trial Court, the Claim was only for a sum of Rs. one lac.

6. The learned counsel for the Insurance company contended that the appellant cannot be permitted to amend the claim petition and claim enhanced compensation. As against this, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that under the Act there is no prohibition for amending the claim petition and in any case Order 6 Rule 17 CPC is applicable to such claim petition under Karnataka Motor Vehicles Rules. Hence, it is the discretion of the Court to permit amendment of the claim petition is appropriate case.

7. Firstly, under the provisions of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, (hereinafter referred to as ""the MV Act"") there is no restriction that compensation could be awarded only up to the amount claimed by the claimant. In an appropriate case where from the evidence brought on record if Tribunal court considers that claimant is entitled to get more compensation than claimed, the Tribunal may pass such award. Only embargo is--it should be 'Just' compensation, that is to say, it should be neither arbitrary, fanciful nor unjustifiable from the evidence. This would be clear by reference to the relevant provisions of the M.V. Act. Section 166 provides that an application for compensation arising out of an accident involving the death of, or bodily injury to, persons arising out of the use of motor vehicles, or damages to any property of a third party so arising, or both, could be made (a) by the person who has sustained the injury; or (b) by the owner of the property; or (c) where death has resulted from the accident, by all or any of the legal representatives of the deceased: or (d) by any agent duly authorised by the person injured or all or any of the legal representatives of the deceased, as the case may be. Under the proviso to Sub-section (1), all the legal representatives of the deceased who have not joined as the claimants are to be impleaded as respondents to the application for compensation. Other important part of the said Section is Sub-section (4) which provides that ""the Claims Tribunal shall treat any report of accidents forwarded to it under Sub-section (6) of Section 158 as an application for compensation under this Act."" Hence, Claims Tribunal in appropriate case can treat the report forwarded to it as an application for compensation even though no such claim is made or no specified amount is claimed.

8. Sub-section (6) of Section 158 read thus:--

""158. Production of certain certificates, licence and permit in certain cases.--.....

(6) As soon as any information regarding any accident involving death or bodily injury to any person is recorded or report under this section is completed by a police officer, the officer incharge of the police station shall forward a copy of the same within thirty days from the date of recording of information or, as the case may be, on completion of such report to the Claims Tribunal having jurisdiction and a copy thereof to the concerned insurer, and where a copy is made available to the owner, he shall also within thirty days of receipt of such report, forward the same to such Claims Tribunal and Insurer.""

9. It appears that due importance is not given to Sub-section (4) of Section 166 which provides that the Tribunal shall treat any report of the accidents forwarded to it under Sub-section (6) of Section 158, as an application for compensation under this Act.

10. Thereafter, Section 168 empowers the Claims Tribunal to ""make an award determining the amount of compensation which appears to it to be just"". Therefore, only requirement for determining the compensation is that it must be 'just'. There is no other limitation or restriction on its power for awarding just compensation.

11. Secondly, under Section 169, the Claims Tribunal in holding any inquiry under Section 168 is required to follow the rules that are made in this behalf and follow such summary procedure as it thinks fit. In the present case, it has been pointed out that Rule 253 of Karnataka Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 empowers the Claims Tribunal to exercise all or any of the powers vested in a Civil Court under the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Rules 254 inter alia makes specific provision that Order 6 Rule 17 CPC is applicable to such proceedings. In this view of the matter, in an appropriate case, depending upon the facts and the evidence which has been brought on record and in the interest of justice, Court may permit amendment of claim petition so as to award enhanced compensation. Further, for amendment of the pleadings, it is settled law that unless it causes injustice to other side or it is not necessary for the purpose of determining real issue between the parties. Court would grant amendment. It is also to be stated that under the M.V. Act there is no time limit prescribed for claiming compensation. Therefore, there is no question of enhanced claim being barred by limitation.

12. This Court in Sheikhupura Transport Co. Ltd. v. Northern Indian Transport Insurance Co. MANU/SC/0539/1971MANU/SC/0539/1971 : AIR1971SC1624 observed as under:-

"".....the pecuniary loss to the aggrieved party would depend upon data which cannot be ascertained accurately but must be necessarily be an estimate or even partly a conjecture....

The determination of the question of compensation depends on several imponderables. In the assessment of those imponderables, there is likely to be a margin of error.....""

13. Hence, as stated earlier, it is for the Tribunal to determine just compensation from the evidence which is brought on record despite the fact that claimant has not precisely stated the amount of damages of compensation which he is entitled to. If evidence on record justifies passing of such award, the claim cannot be rejected solely on the ground that claimant has restricted this claim. From 63 of the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Rates, 1989, which is for filing an application for compensation, does not provide that claimant should specify his claim amount. It inter alia provides that he should mention his monthly income as well as the nature of injury sustained and medical certificates.

14. In case, where there is evidence on record justifying the enhanced compensation for the medical treatment which is required because of the injury caused to a claimant due to the accident, there is no reason why such amendment or enhanced compensation should not be granted. In such cases, there is no question of introducing a new or inconsistent cause of action. Cause of action and evidence remain the same. Only Question is - application of law as it stands.

15. Mr. P.K. Chakravarty, learned counsel appearing for the Insurance Company, in support of his contention that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to award higher amount of compensation than what is claimed even though it is not likely to cause prejudice to the Insurance Company, heavily relied upon the decision rendered by the Full Bench of the High Court of Gujarat in Dr. Urmila J. Sangani v. Pragjibhai Mohanlal Luvana and Ors. MANU/GJ/0167/2000MANU/GJ/0167/2000 : AIR2000Guj211 . In that case, the High Court after considering relevant decisions on the subject observed thus:--

""....We may mention that when the claimant feels that he is entitled to more compensation than what is claimed in the petition, it is always open to him/her to amend the claim petition and if the same is in consonance with the equity, justice and good conscience, there is no reason why the Claims Tribunal should not grant amendment. Before compensation more than claimed is awarded, the opposite parties should be put to notice, the requisite additional issue/issue should be raised and the parties should be permitted to adduce their evidence on the additional issues, but if no such opportunity is given, the procedure would obviously suffer from material irregularity affecting the decision.""

16. From the aforesaid observations it cannot be held that there is a bar for the Claims Tribunal to award the compensation in excess of what is claimed, particularly when the evidence which is brought on record is sufficient to pass such award. In cases where there is no evidence on record, the Court may permit such amendment and allow to raise additional issue and give an opportunity to the parties to produce relevant evidence.

17. In support of her contention, the learned counsel for the appellant Mrs. Kiran Suri referred to the decision of Bombay High Court in Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay and Anr. v. Kisan Gangaram Hire and Ors. MANU/MH/0739/1987MANU/MH/0739/1987 : 1987 ACJ 311 wherein the Court dealt with similar contention and observed thus:--

""8. What is further necessary to note is that what gives a cause of action for preferring an application for claim for compensation is the accident by motor vehicle or vehicles and not a particular monetary loss occasioned by such accident. While the compensation in all no fault claim cases is fixed and uniform, in fault claim cases the losses may vary from case to case. The particular losses are merely the consequence of the accident which is the cause of action. This being so, the amounts of compensation claimed are nothing but the particulars of the claim made. By its very nature, further the amount of compensation claimed cannot always be calculated precisely. In many cases it can at best be a fair estimate....""

18. The High Court observed that in all such cases, it is necessary to keep the doors open for the claimant to make the claims, on grounds not stated earlier or for more amounts under heads already specified in the application.

19. The aforesaid decision of the Bombay High Court was relied upon and referred to by the Orissa High Court in Mulla Md. Abdul Wahib v. Abdul Rahim and Anr. MANU/OR/0197/1993MANU/OR/0197/1993 : 1993(I)OLR569 and G.B. Patnaik, J. (as he ten was) observed that the expression ""just compensation"" would obviously mean what is fair, moderate and reasonable and awardable in the proved circumstances of a particular case and the expression ""which appears to it to be just"" vests a wide discretion in the Tribunal in the matter of determining of compensation. Thereafter, the Court referred to the decision in Sheikhupura Transport Co. Ltd. (supra) and held that the pecuniary loss to the aggrieved party would depend upon data which cannot be ascertained accurately but must necessarily be an estimate or even partly a conjecture, and if this is so, then it will be unreasonable to expect the party to state precisely the amount of damages or compensation that it would be entitled to. The Court also held that there are no fetters on the power of the Tribunal to award compensation in excess of the amount which is claimed in the application.

20. Similarly, the High Court of Punjab and Haryana in Devki Nandan Bangur and Ors. v. State of Haryana and Ors. MANU/PH/0565/1993MANU/PH/0565/1993 observed that the grant of just and fair compensation is statutory responsibility of the Court and if, on the facts, the Court finds that the claimant is entitled to higher compensation, the Court should allow the claimant to amend his prayer and allow proper compensation.

21. For the reasons discussed above, in our view, under the M.V. Act, there is no restriction that Tribunal/Court cannot award compensation amount exceeding the claimed amount. The function of the Tribunal/Court is to award 'Just' compensation which is reasonable on the basis of evidence produced on record. Further, in such cases there is no question of claim becoming time barred or it cannot be contended that by enhancing the claim there would be change of cause of action. It is also to be stated that as provided under Sub-section (4) to Section 166, even report submitted to the Claims Tribunal under Sub-section (6) of Section 158 can be treated as an application for compensation under the M.V. Act. If required, in appropriate cases, Court may permit amendment to the Claim Petition.

Is it permissible under the Act to award compensation by installments or recurring compensation to meet the future medical expenses of the victim?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22. To an agriculturist, loss of leg vitally affects not only his working capacity but also his livelihood. In this context, Lord Denning M.R. in Lim Poh Choo v. Camden and Islington Area Healthy Authority [(1979) 1 All ER 332] quoted with approval the observations of Parke B. which are as under:-

'Scarcely any sum could compensate a labouring man for the loss of a limb, yet you do not in such a case give him enough to maintain him for life...You are not to consider the value of existence as if you were bargaining with an annuity office...I advise you to take a reasonable view of the case and give what you consider fair compensation.'

23. However, it is to be clearly understood that M.V. Act does not provide for passing of further award after final award is passed. Therefore, in a case where injury to a victim requires periodical medical expenses, fresh award cannot be passed or previous award cannot be reviewed when the medical expenses are incurred after finalisation of the compensation proceedings. Hence, only alternative is that at the time of passing of final award, Tribunal/Court should consider such eventuality and fix compensation accordingly. No one can suggest that it is improper to take into account expenditure genuinely and reasonably required to be incurred for future medical expenses. Future medical expenses required to be incurred can be determined only on the basis of fair guess-work after taking into account increase in the cost of medical treatment.

24. This position is made clear in Union Carbide Corporation and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0058/1992MANU/SC/0058/1992 : AIR1992SC248 where this Court observed as under:-

"".....In an action for negligence, damages must be and are assessed once and for all at the trial of such an issue. Even if it is found later that the damage suffered was much greater than was originally supposed, no further action could be brought. It is well settled rule of law that damages resulting from one and the same cause of action must be assessed and recovered once and for all. Two actions, therefore, will not lie against the same defendant for personal injury sustained in the same accident.""

25. Further, compensation to a victim of a motor vehicle accident or in case of a fatal accident to the legal representatives is awarded under two heads, namely, Special damages - which are suffered by the victim or the legal representatives and General damages - which include compensation for pain and sufferings, loss of amenities, earning capacity and prospective expenses including expenses for medical treatment. With regard to the first part of the damages, that is, special damages suffered by the victim or the legal representative, it can be easily proved on the basis of the evidence which is in possession of the claimant. However with regard to the second part-- general damages/compensation, it would be a matter of conjectures depending on number of imponderables. In Lim Poh Choo case (supra), Lord Denning observed as under:-

""...The practice is now established and cannot be gain said that, in personal injury cases, the award of damages is assessed under four main heads: first, special damages in the shape of money actually expended; second, cost of future nursing and attendance and medical expenses; third, pain and suffering and loss of amenities; fourth, loss of future earnings.""

26. While calculating such damages, the Tribunal/Court is required to have some guess work taking into account the inflation factor. This aspect is well discussed by M.J. Rao, J. (as he then was)] in P. Satyanarayana v. I. Babu Rajendra Prasad and Anr. MANU/AP/0263/1987MANU/AP/0263/1987 : 1988 ACJ 88 . The learned Judge has given a Classification or Injuries: A Useful Guide and has observed thus:-

""24. If a collection of cases on the quantum of damages is to be useful, it must necessarily be classified in such a way that comparable cases can be grouped together. No doubt, no two cases are alike but still, it is possible to make a broad classification which enables one to bring comparable awards together. Such classifications have been made by Bingham in his Motor Claims Cases, Munkman in his Employer's Liability and Kemp & Kemp in their Quantum of Damages. (Munkman p. 181).

26. Cases relating to injuries have been classified into four categories, i.e.: (a) total works; (b) partial wrecks and (c) where limits and eyes and other specific parts of the body are lost, which can be sub-grouped according to the type of limb lost and (b) smaller injuries which cannot be specifically grouped but for which compensation can be assessed by comparison with injuries of loss of limbs, e.g., comparing permanent 'wrist injuries' with 'loss of hand', or comparing a temporary broken arm with the loss of the arm etc. Such comparisons are often made by judges. Munkman points out that in America, Mr. Melvin M. Belli, an eminent lawyer, classified injuries into 11 categories as (1) Back; (2) Traumatic amputation of leg; (3) Paralysis; (4) Hand or arm off; (5) Death; (6) Multiple fractures; (7) Burns; (8) Personality change; (9) Blindness; (10) Brain injury and (11) Occupation diseases. By 1967, awards (say) for blindness had risen to 930,000 dollars (Munkman pp. 181-182). Today after 20 years, these awards must have gone up further. The 'total wreck' category comprises of cases of complete incapacity for work and virtually no enjoyment of life, e.g., paralysis, severe brain injury causing insanity, multiple injuries leaving the victim a total cripple. The 'partial wreek' cases are also cases where the entire body is affected and not one set of limbs alone as in the third category. Cases of brain injuries resulting in a personality change and multiple injuries with grave disfigurement fall in this second category. The third category does not present much difficulty for sub-classification. The fourth category deals with minor injuries in a limb which be compared with major injuries in the same limb.

Past Inflation--Relevancy of Date of Accident:

27. The dates of accident resulting in similar injuries have great relevancy. For example, if a particular conventional sum of (say) Rs. 10,000/- was awarded towards the non-pecuniary damages of loss of expectation of life, loss or amenities and pain and suffering--all put together--in a case of amputation of a leg consequent to an accident in 1970, the award to be made for an identical loss today would have to be upgraded from the 1970 value to its value in 1987, having regard to the corrosion of the value of the rupee. This can be done by comparing the cost of living index in 1970 with that in 1987. Charles worth on Negligence, 6th Edn., 1977, para 14, says, the 'conventional figures' must keep 'pace with the times in which we live'. He says that this can be well illustrated by considering the class of injury resulting (say) in the loss of sight in one eye and the conventional sum lay around  2000 about a quarter of a century ago but today in 1977 it will probably exceed  5000 or it ought to do. Kemp & Kemp on Damages, 1982, Chapter 7, para 7001, say: If a court is seeking to make a comparison with some earlier award (for non-pecuniary losses) and if by the date of the comparison, the currency in which the earlier award was made has declined by, say, 50 per cent, one must surely double the earlier award in order to make a valid comparison. The authors have compiled two tables (at paras 7007 and 7008), one showing the current level of general damages for 'pain and suffering' and 'loss of amenities' in cases of severe injury and the other showing similar earlier years, and have compared whether courts are or are not keeping pace with inflation. The authors ask, why tort-feasors alone, as a class should be excused from paying the value-based price? In Walker v. John McLean & Sons Ltd., 1980 ACJ 429 (CA England), the court found that while the value of the pound fell by 50% between 1957 and 1972 (over a period of 15 years), there was a steeper fall between 1973 to 1978 (within 5 years) when it again fell by 50% (vide Kemp & Kemp's Tables). 'Conventional' figures, if they do not keep pace with inflation, might indeed become 'contemptible'. Kemp & Kemp point out that an award of  16000 in 1879 would be about  500,000 in 1982. After Walker's case (supra), courts in England are carefully adjusting awards for 'pain and suffering' and 'loss of amenities' to keep pace with inflation.""

27. Further, the Division Bench of the High Court of Kerala in Valiyakathodi Mohammed Koya v. Ayyappankadu Ramamoorthi Mohan and Ors. MANU/KE/0011/1991MANU/KE/0011/1991 : AIR1991Ker47 considered the principle of assessment of compensation for deprivation of amenities of life in a case where an injured boy aged 12 years suffered brain damage because of the accident and has rightly pointed out that in personal injury cases there are three categories of general damages: consolatory damages, compensatory damages and damages for loss of expectation of life and explained it by illustrating thus:--

""The amputation of a hand preventing a plaintiff from playing cricket would merit consolatory damages; the same loss preventing a man from carrying on his employment would merit compensatory damages. Consolatory and compensatory damages represent different elements in an award for general damages for personal injuries and are exhaustive except for the third head of damages for loss of expectation of life which is sui generis.""

28. Thereafter, the Court observed thus:--

""...The award is final. There is no procedure prescribed to review the award in future which would enable a substitution of real fact for estimate, Mankind is denied the privilege of knowledge of the future with certainty. The result is so much of the award as is attributed to the future loss and suffering will almost surely be liable to err. In Lim Poh Choo v. Camden and Islington Area Health Authority, 1979 ACJ 362 (CA England), considering the insuperable complexities of the problem, Lord Denning, MR, said that the decision should not be considered as final and it should be considered as an interim award liable to be reviewed. The House of Lords in Lim Poh Choo v. Camden and Islington Area Health Authority, 1980 ACJ 486 (HL England), speaking through Lord Scarman said:

'It is an attractive, ingenious suggestion, but in my judgment unsound. For so radical a reform can be made neither by judges nor by modification of rules of court'.""

29. In this view of the matter, in our view, it would be difficult to hold that for future medical expenses which are required to be incurred by a victim, fresh award could be passed. However, for such medical treatment, Court has to arrive at a reasonable estimate on the basis of the evidence brought on record. In the present case, it has been pointed out that for replacing the artificial leg every two to three years, appellant would be required to have some sort of operation and also change the artificial leg. At that time, the estimate expenses for this were Rs. 18000/- and the High Court has awarded the said amount. For change of artificial leg every two or three years no compensation is awarded. Considering this aspect, if Rs. One lac is awarded as an additional compensation, appellant would be in a position to meet the said expenses from the interest of the said amount. Equally it is true that the said amount is required to be properly invested on long-term basis so that recurring medical expenses could be met. This principle is established in General Manager, Kerala State Road Transport Corporation, Trivandrum v. Susamma Thomas (Mrs.) and Ors. MANU/SC/0389/1994MANU/SC/0389/1994 : AIR1994SC1631 and this Court held (in para 23) thus:--

""23. In a case of compensation for death it is appropriate that the Tribunals do keep in mind the principles enunciated by this Court in Union Carbide Corporation v. Union of India MANU/SC/0058/1992MANU/SC/0058/1992 : AIR1992SC248 in the matter of appropriate investments to safeguard the feed from being frittered away by the beneficiaries owing to ignorance, illiteracy and susceptibility to exploitation. In that case approving the judgment of the Gujarat High Court in Muljibhai Ajarambhai Harijan v. United India Insurance Co. Ltd. MANU/GJ/0141/1982MANU/GJ/0141/1982 : (1982)1GLR756, this Court offered the following guidelines:--

(i) The Claims Tribunal should, in the case of minors, invariably order the amount of compensation awarded to the minor be invested in long term fixed deposits at least till the date of the minor attaining majority. The expenses incurred by the guardian or next friend may, however, be allowed to be withdrawn:

(ii) In the case of illiterate claimants also the Claims Tribunal should follow the procedure set out in (i) above, but if lump sum payment is required for effecting purchases of any movable or immovable property such as, agricultural implements, rickshaw, etc., to earn a living, the Tribunal may consider such a request after making sure that the amount is actually spent for the purpose and the demand is not a ruse to withdraw money;

(iii) In the case of semi-literate persons the Tribunal should ordinarily resort to the procedure set out at (i) above unless it is satisfied, for reasons to be stated in writing, that the whole or part of the amount is required for expanding and existing business or for purchasing some property as mentioned in (ii) above for earning his livelihood, in which case the Tribunal will ensure that the amount is invested for the purpose for which it is demanded and paid;

(iv) In the case of literate persons also the Tribunal may resort to the procedure indicated in (i) above, subject to the relaxation set out in (ii) and (iii) above, if having regard to the age, fiscal background and strata of society to which the claimant belongs and such other considerations, the Tribunal in the larger interest of the claimant and with a view to ensuring the safety of the compensation awarded to him thinks it necessary to do order;

(v) In the case of windows the Claims Tribunal should invariably follow the procedure set out in (i) above;

(vi) In personal injury cases if further treatment is necessary the Claims Tribunal on being satisfied about the same, which shall be recorded in writing, permit withdrawal of such amount as is necessary for incurring the expenses for such treatment;

(vii) In all cases in which investment in long term fixed deposits is made it should be on condition that the Bank will not permit any loan or advance on the fixed deposit and interest on the amount invested is paid monthly directly to the claimant or his guardian, as the case may be;

(viii) In all cases Tribunal should grant to the claimants liberty to apply for withdrawal in case of an emergency. To meet with such a contingency, if the amount awarded is substantial, the Claims Tribunal may invest it in more than one Fixed Deposit so that if need be one such F.D.R. can be liquidated.""

30. Further, in Lilaben Udesing Gobel v. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. and Ors. MANU/SC/0420/1996MANU/SC/0420/1996 : [1996]3SCR450 the Court relied upon the said directions and further held that in Union Carbide Corporation's case (supra), this Court did not include the clause regarding literate persons' compensation and directed that it should be given the same treatment in case the Court found it necessary to do so to protect the compensation awarded to them. The Court further added one guideline as under:--

""We must add one further guideline to the effect that when the amount is invested in a fixed deposit, the bank should invariably be directed to affix a note on the fixed deposit receipt that no loan or advance should be granted on the strength of the said FDR without the express permission of the Court/Tribunal which ordered the deposit. This will eliminate the practice of taking loans which may be up to 80% of the amount invested and thereby defeating the very purpose of the order. We do hope that the Courts/Tribunal in the country will not succumb to the temptation of permitting huge withdrawals in the hope of disposing of the claim. We are sure that the Courts/Tribunals will realise their duty towards the victims of the accident so that a large part of the compensation amount is not lost to them. The very purpose of laying down the guidelines was to ensure the safety of the amount so that the claimants do not become victims of unscrupulous persons and unethical agreements or arrangements. We do hope our anxiety to protect the claimants from exploitation by such elements will be equally shared by the Courts Tribunals.""

31. In the result, we allow this appeal partly and award additional compensation of Rs. One lac to the appellant. The said amount shall be deposited by the Insurance Company with the trial Court and the trial Court is directed to invest the said amount on long term fixed deposit in a nearest nationalised bank, in the area where the appellant is residing, wit the condition that the bank will not permit any loan or advance and the interest on the said amount will be paid annually, directly to the claimant till the survives. However, on an application by the appellant this condition could be modified by the Tribunal in exceptional circumstances, if made out by the appellant. Finally, after the death of appellant, the amount be disbursed to his legal heirs on their application.

32. The aforesaid condition is imposed so as to see that appellant does not find it difficult to meet periodical medical expenses as required by him.

33. Appeal is allowed accordingly. There shall be no order as to costs.

L. Nageswara Rao, J.

1. These Appeals are filed against the judgment of the High Court of Uttarakhand at Nainital by which a direction was issued to restrict the selection of Assistant Prosecuting Officers only to the number of posts that were advertised.

2. An advertisement was issued by the Uttarakhand Public Service Commission (hereinafter referred to as 'the Second Respondent') on 19.09.2009 for appointment to the posts of Assistant Prosecuting Officers. The number of posts notified were 38. It was mentioned in the advertisement that the number of posts may be increased or decreased by the State Government. A preliminary examination was contemplated in case there were a large number of applications. It was mentioned in the advertisement that the 'year of recruitment' was a period of 12 months commencing from the 1st day of July of the calendar year.

3. As a large number of candidates applied, a preliminary examination was conducted on 31.10.2010, the result of which was declared on 04.02.2011. The Third Respondent who was an applicant filed an application under the Right to Information Act, 2005 seeking information about the number of posts for which the preliminary examination was conducted. The Second Respondent responded stating that the number of vacancies for which the selection was being held was 74. The Third Respondent filed a Writ Petition in the High Court of Uttarakhand at Nainital for a direction that only 38 posts of Assistant Prosecuting Officers which were advertised on 19.09.2009 should be filled up.

4. A counter was filed by the First Respondent stating that 37 additional posts of Assistant Prosecuting Officers were created by an order dated 25.08.2009. It was also stated in the counter that a requisition for additional 36 posts of Assistant Prosecuting Officers was sent to the Second Respondent. It was further stated that there was acute shortage of Assistant Prosecuting Officers and hence there was need for filling up of 74 vacant posts of Assistant Prosecuting Officers without delay.

5. The High Court allowed the Writ Petition. The High Court relied on Uttar Pradesh Prosecuting Officers Service Rules, 1991 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Rules') to hold that the selection pursuant to an advertisement can be only for clear vacancies and anticipated vacancies but not for future vacancies. Referring to the definition of 'year of recruitment' in the Rules, the High Court held that vacancies that arose between 1st of July, 2008 and 30th of June, 2009 alone can be filled up. The High Court directed that selection should be confined to only 38 posts of Assistant Prosecuting Officers. A further direction was given by the High Court to the Second Respondent to commence the process of selection for the additional 36 vacancies which were requisitioned by the letter dated 06.01.2011.

6. The Appellants would have been selected and appointed as Assistant Prosecuting Officers if the selection was for 74 posts. They are aggrieved by the judgment of the High Court. They have sought permission to file the above Appeals which was granted on 16.08.2012. We heard Mr. Harin P. Raval and Ms. Meenakshi Arora, learned Senior Counsels appearing for the Appellants and Mr. Saurabh Trivedi, Counsel appearing for the First Respondent. Mr. Harin Raval submitted that there was only one Assistant Prosecuting Officer working in the State of Uttarakhand on the date of advertisement dated 19.09.2009. Mr. Raval took us through the material on record to show that more than 38 posts were available on the date of advertisement. He referred to the condition in the advertisement which enabled the State Government to vary the number of vacancies. He also referred to the pleadings to contend that a requisition was made to the Second Respondent for filling up the additional 36 vacancies as well. He submitted that the High Court went wrong in allowing the Writ Petition without taking into account the shortage of Assistant Prosecuting Officers in the State of Uttarakhand. Mr. Saurabh Trivedi, counsel appearing for the State supported the Appellants and sought permission to fill up the additional 36 vacancies.

7. Thirty seven candidates were declared successful for being appointed as Assistant Prosecuting Officers by a Notification dated 26.06.2012. It is stated in the written submission filed by the First Respondent that 31 out of 37 candidates joined and were sent for training. Two candidates out of 31 resigned and the remaining 29 candidates were assigned postings as Assistant Prosecuting Officers.

8. The recruitment to posts of Assistant Prosecuting Officers is governed by the Uttar Pradesh Prosecuting Officers Service Rules, 1991. Rule 3(1) defines 'year of recruitment' as a period of 12 months commencing from the 1st day of July of calendar year. The requisition made by the First Respondent to the Second Respondent on 17.11.2008 was for selection of 38 Assistant Prosecuting Officers. The year of recruitment for conducting selection would be between 1st July, 2008 and 30th June, 2009. As stated earlier, only 38 posts were notified in the advertisement. As per the advertisement the Government could vary the number of posts to be filled up. Such power could have been exercised by the Government only to the extent of posts that arose between 1st July, 2008 and 30th June, 2009. The Second Respondent filed a counter in this Court in which it was stated that the advertisement issued on 19.09.2009 was for 38 posts and that it was only on 06.01.2011 that the Government intimated 36 additional posts to be filled up. The letter dated 25.08.2009 of the Chief Secretary, State of Uttarakhand was relied upon by the Appellants to contend that additional vacancies were created and they were available to be filled up.

9. It is clear from the pleadings and the various documents filed by the Appellants that no additional posts were created between 1st July, 2008 and 30th June, 2009. It is significant that the Rules refer to the recruitment year. It is a well-accepted principle of service law that only the number of vacancies that are advertised can be filled up. If the advertisement gives liberty to the Government to vary the number of posts, such power cannot be exercised for filling up future vacancies. If additional posts were created during the recruitment year i.e. between 1st July, 2008 and 30th June, 2009, the Government could have directed the Second Respondent to include those posts also in the selection list that was made pursuant to the advertisement dated 19.09.2009.

10. This Court in Prem Singh and Ors. v. Haryana State Electricity Board reported in MANU/SC/1151/1996MANU/SC/1151/1996 : (1996) 4 SCC 319 at paragraph 25 held as follows:

From the above discussion of the case-law it becomes clear that the selection process by way of requisition and advertisement can be started for clear vacancies and also for anticipated vacancies but not for future vacancies. If the requisition and advertisement are for a certain number of posts only the State cannot make more appointments then the number of posts advertised, even though it might have prepared a select list of more candidates. The State can deviate from the advertisement and make appointments on posts falling vacant thereafter in exceptional circumstances only or in an emergent situation and that too by taking a policy decision in that behalf. Even when filling up of more posts than advertised is challenged the Court may not, while exercising its extra-ordinary jurisdiction, invalidate the excess appointments and may mould the relief in such a manner as to strike a just balance between the interest of the State and the interest of persons seeking public employment. What relief should be granted in such cases would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.

It was further held by this Court that strictly speaking the authorities were not justified in making appointments to posts more than those advertised. This Court also found that only actual vacancies were taken into account without considering the anticipated vacancies that were likely to arise due to retirement, etc. As appointments were already made, taking into account the peculiar facts and circumstances, this Court approved the appointments beyond those advertised only to the extent of vacancies which arose because of death and retirement, etc. The appointments that were made to future vacancies were declared as invalid.

11. Pursuant to the directions issued by the High Court in the impugned judgment, 37 persons were declared selected for appointment. In view of the interim order passed by this Court in the above Appeals, selection to the remaining posts was not held. Seven years have passed after the advertisement was issued on 19.09.2009. A large number of persons would have become eligible for selection to the post of Assistant Prosecuting Officers. They have a right to be considered for appointment guaranteed under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. There would be an infraction of such right if the additional posts are not filled up by a fresh selection. The attempt made by the First and Second Respondents to fill up the additional posts is contrary to the Rules. After a careful consideration of the matter, we are of the opinion that the Appellants cannot be selected and appointed to the additional posts that were not advertised on 19.09.2009 and were created after the relevant recruitment year ending on 30.06.2009.

12. We have examined the possibility of granting relief to the Appellants by taking into account the facts and circumstances of this case. The Appellants participated in the selection which was initially for 38 posts which later increased to 74 posts. They could not be appointed due to the judgment of the High Court which directed the selection to be only for 38 posts. In view of there being no fault on the part of the Appellants, we examined whether we could exercise our judicial discretion to direct their appointments. We realise that any such direction given by us for their appointments would be contrary to the Rules. Judicial discretion can be exercised by a Court only when there are two or more possible lawful solutions. In any event, Courts cannot give any direction contrary to the Statute or Rules made thereunder in exercise of judicial discretion. It will be useful to reproduce from Judicial Discretion (1989) by Aharon Barak which is as follows:

Discretion assumes the freedom to choose among several lawful alternatives. Therefore, discretion does not exist when there is but one lawful option. In this situation, the judge is required to select that option and has no freedom of choice. No discretion is involved in the choice between a lawful act and an unlawful act. The judge must choose the lawful act, and he is precluded from choosing the unlawful act. Discretion, on the other hand, assumes the lack of an obligation to choose one particular possibility among several.

13. As we have held that the selection pursuant to the advertisement dated 19.09.2009 should be confined only to posts that were advertised, the additional posts that were created after the expiry of the recruitment year shall be filled up by issuance of an advertisement afresh. In view of the shortage of Assistant Prosecuting Officers in the State of Uttarakhand, we direct the authorities to expedite the process of selection.

14. For the aforementioned reasons, the judgment of the High Court is upheld and the Civil Appeals are dismissed.

Ashok Bhan, J.

1. Appellant-Delhi Development Authority (hereinafter referred to as 'the Authority') formulated a Scheme known as ""Registration Scheme on New Pattern - 1979"" (for short ""the Scheme"") to build and sell MIG/LIG and Janta flats so as to be within the reach of the common man.

2. Registration for the scheme opened on 1st September, 1979. In the Scheme the illustrated price of various categories of flats were mentioned. The likely cost of MIG flats with which we are concerned in these appeals was indicated to be Rs. 42,000/-. On 30th of September, 1979, registration was closed. About 1,70,000 persons registered themselves in the scheme. In 1981, allotment started taking place by draw of lots based on randomized allotment. The cost of flats was worked out after taking into account the prevailing rate of land by the Lt. Governor. The cost of construction was worked out by dividing the cost incurred in construction of a pocket of flats by a number of flats in that pocket. Clauses 13 & 14 of the brochure are as follows:

""Clause 13. The plinth area of the flats to be constructed under new pattern is likely to be as under:-

MIG Between 60 to 65 Sq.Mtrs.

LIG About 38 Sq.Mtrs.

Janta Upto 24 Sq.Mtrs.

The accommodation in the flats under different categories will be as under:-

MIG One Living Room, 2 Bed Rooms, Kitchen, Bath Room and W.C. and Open Court-yard.

LIG 2 Rooms, Kitchen, Bath Room and W.C.

Janta One room, Kitchen, Bath Room and W.C.

The likely cost of flats constructed under this scheme will be as under:-

MIG Rs. 42,000/-

LIG Rs. 18,000/-

Janta Rs. 8,000/-

The prices are indicative and do not represent the final cost.

14. It may please be noted that the plinth area of the flats indicated and the estimated prices mentioned in the brochure are illustrative and are subject to revision/modification depending upon the exigencies or lay out, cost of construction etc"" .

(Emphasis supplied)

3. Due to certain reasons with which we are not concerned at the moment, the allotments could not be made. On 6th of December, 1990 fresh rates of land to be taken into account for costing of flats were approved by the Lt. Governor. Whereas in 1979 the prevailing land rate was fixed at Rs. 62/- per sq.meter, the same was revised in 1990 to Rs. 870/- per sq.meter for MIG flats, Rs. 660/- per sq.meter for LIG flats and Rs. 500/- per sq. meter for EWS (Janta flats). The increased rate was approved after taking into consideration all the relevant factors involved.

4. The respondents-writ petitioners (hereinafter to as 'the respondents') whose turn for allotment came in 1991 were allotted flats in Jahangirpuri. The demand letters were sent to them. Respondents filed the writ petition No. 3267 of 1991 along with Civil Writ Nos. 3198, 3456, 3645, 3795 and 3796 of 1991 respectively in Delhi High Court challenging the rate at which the flats were being allotted. The case put up by them was that the amount being charged for the flats was much higher than what was indicated in the scheme itself.

5. Writ Petition Nos. 3876 of 1992 titled Prem Chand vs. Union of India & Anr., CWP 2787 of 1990 J.K. Dhingra vs. DDA, CWP 728 of 1991 Vinod Kumar Gupta vs. DDA, and CWP 1327 of 1991 Maha Nand Sharma vs. DDA also filed on the same grounds and for the same were dismissed on 24th May, 1993, 16th May, 1991, 22nd October, 1991 and 15th January, 1992, respectively.

6. Writ Petitions filed by the respondents were allowed by the High Court despite the fact that several similar writ petitions had already been dismissed on merits. By the impugned judgment the High Court struck down the revision in the rate of land. The Authority was directed to make allotment of flats at a tentative price of four and a half time of the price 'offered in the year 1979. Further the Authority was directed to constitute an Expert Committee to go into the costing of the flats taking the land rate at Rs. 62/- per sq.meter. The Expert Committee was to work out the price after taking into account the actual cost of construction made by it for the construction of the flats. If the Expert Committee after working out the cost on the basis of aforesaid works out cost to be more than the price that was provisionally fixed then the Authority was put at liberty to revise the cost and intimate to the respondents requiring them to make the payment within a month of such intimation.

7. Another set of writ petitions 1121/91, 1102/93, 1059/94, 874/94, 1009/94, 1019/94, 1451/94 and 1628 of 1994 which were for similar relief came up for hearing before another Division Bench. Arguments were heard and orders were reserved. A miscellaneous application being CM No. 6491 of 1993 was filed in writ petition No. 1121 of 1991 to report that another Division Bench had pronounced judgment in Writ Petition No. 3267 of 1991 (writ petition filed by the respondents) on August 25, 1993 which had a direct bearing on the controversy involved, in which similar issues had been considered and decided. The relief similar to the some claimed in petition had been granted. A prayer was made that the writ petitions be disposed of in terms of the said judgment. On notice, the authority resisted the application saying that important decisions vital to the issue raised had escaped attention of the Court in CWP 3267 of 1991 and as such the same was not binding. Keeping in mind the divergent views expressed by different Benches of equal strength, the Division Bench felt it appropriate that the matter be decided by a larger bench and in particular the following questions:

""1. Whether under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, this Court can interfere in the matter of pricing/costing of flats including escalation in cost of land particularly in view of Clause No. 13 and 14 of the brochure regarding the Registration Scheme on New Pattern-1979 under which the petitioners are registrants for allotment of flats?

2. Is the impugned revision of cost of land by the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi illegal and arbitrary?""

8. Thus, on their recommendation, a Full Bench was constituted to decide the aforesaid questions.

9. The fact that the matter had been referred to a larger Bench doubting the correctness of the view expressed in the impugned judgment was brought to the notice of this Court in the present appeals. This Court on 7th February, 1994 adjourned the case sine die to await the decision of the Full Bench and passed the following order:

""We are told at the bar that the instant decision under appeal has been doubted by another Division Bench of the High Court. Apparently there exists a conflict of opinion raging in the High Court on the question raised herein. It appears that CWP No. 1121/91 Sheela Wanti vs. Delhi Development Authority and other batch cases stands referred to a Full Bench by an order of a Division Bench dated 22nd September, 1993. We feel that in this situation it would be appropriate that the High Court itself puts to order its own views. We, therefore, send a request to the Chief Justice of the High Court to constitute a Full Bench, if possible, within 3 weeks and have the matter listed and heard as expeditiously as possible. We on our part hold over this matter awaiting the decision of the Full Bench.

The matter is adjourned sine die with the liberty to mention"".

10. The authority filed a detailed affidavit before the Full Bench along with the documents explaining as to how likely cost of the flats mentioned in 1979 was arrived at, the component of land price in the said cost, the basis thereof and increase in the land price, if any, between 1979 and 1990. The basis on which the price was enhanced was also indicated which ultimately resulted in the issuance of the notification by the Lt. Governor of Delhi dated 6th December, 1990 fixing the revised rates which was impugned in the writ petitions filed in the High Court.

11. The points which were referred to the Full Bench were answered in the negative, i.e. in favour of the authority and against the allottees. It was held that the scope of judicial review in the cases involving costing and fixation of prices was very much limited.

12. In the concluding portions, the two points referred to the Full Bench were answered in the following terms:

""We may now advert to the questions referred to the Full Bench. In keeping without observations and findings recorded above, we are of the opinion that in view of Clause 13 and 14 of the brochure and the transaction being contractual, this court cannot interfere under Article 226 of the Constitution in the matter of pricing/costing of flats, including escalation of cost of land, etc. The answer to the first question has to be in the negative.

As regards the second question referred to the Full Bench, as noticed above, we are of the view that the impugned revision of by the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi is neither illegal nor arbitrary.""

13. The decision of the Full Bench was challenged in this Court by filing Special leave petition (C) No. 13508 of 1995 and the same was dismissed on 14th July, 1995.

14. Special leave petitions in the present appeals were listed before the Bench on 20th October, 1995. Counsel for the respondents raised an argument that since the special leave petitions against the Full Bench judgment were dismissed in limine, he would like to challenge the correctness of the Full Bench judgment. Keeping in view this submission, this Court granted the leave to file the appeals. The order passed by the Court is in the following terms:

""Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the impugned judgment by a Division Bench of the High Court is contrary to the subsequent Full Bench decision of the same High Court against which Special Leave Petition has been dismissed by this Court. Learned counsel further submits that other similar SLPs were also dismissed by this Court which amounts to affirmance of the Full Bench decision dated 3rd February, 1995 (at page 143-79 of the paper book). On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent submits that the dismissal of the SLPs being in limine , he would like to challenge the correctness of the Full Bench judgment and therefore the hearing will take some time.

For the above reason, we grant special leave in all the special leave petitions. In the meantime operation of the impugned judgment shall remain stayed"".

15. From the facts narrated above, it is evident that there was a difference of opinion between co-equal benches of the High Court regarding fixation of the price of MIG flats in the same scheme. Since there was a divergence of opinion, the matter was referred to a Full Bench to resolve the conflict in the views expressed. The conclusion arrived at by the Full Bench run contrary to the view expressed by the Division Bench in the impugned judgments.

16. Shri Hardev Singh, senior advocate appearing for the respondents strenuously contended that the view expressed in the impugned judgment before us was not overruled by the Full Bench, rather the same was approved. Relying upon the following observations:

""The consistent view of this Court, thus, was that escalation in prices of the flats constructed by the DDA under different schemes, including the present scheme, could not be challenged under Article 226 of the Constitution till the decision in Ashok Kumar Behl vs. DDA (1993) 52 DLT 153, in which the Court went into the question of pricing and quashed the escalated price of the flats allotted under the scheme. It appears that the Court did so apparently for the reason that despite specific directions in that behalf the DDA had failed to place the relevant material before the Court to explain how the price fixation had been done and on what basis. Court queries in this behalf were not answered, which led to the belief that the DDA was suppressing something and had acted arbitrarily to the prejudice of the writ petitioners. These significant factors put the case out of the ambit of the ratio of the Bareilli Development Authority's case"".

It was stressed that since the DDA had failed to produce the relevant material before the Court to explain how the price fixation had been done ratio of this Court's Judgment in Bareilly Development Authority v. Ajai Pal Singh, MANU/SC/0058/1989MANU/SC/0058/1989 : [1989]1SCR743 , was not applicable. That the Division Bench in the impugned judgment decided the case on the peculiar facts of the case and therefore the same would not be governed by the ratio of the decision of the Full Bench judgment.

17. The contention put forth by the counsel for the respondents cannot be accepted either on facts or in view. Keeping in mind the divergence of views expressed by the co-equal benches the matter was referred to the Full Bench. The Full Bench expressed the view that revision of price by the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi in the year 1991 was neither arbitrary nor illegal, in the other words, the price fixed by the Lieutenant Governor in the year 1991 was upheld whereas the Division Bench in the impugned judgment has taken a dramatically opposite view. In the impugned judgment it has been held that the price fixed by the Lt. Governor in the year 1991 was arbitrary and illegal. The Court after fixing a tentative price directed to constitute an Expert Committee to go into the question of pricing and determine the same after taking the land rate at Rs. 62/- per sq.meter and actual cost of construction made by it for the construction of the flats. The Full Bench did not approve the view expressed by the Division Bench in the impugned judgment, it simply stated that the Division Bench may have come to this conclusion because the Authority failed to place the relevant material before the Court to explain how the price fixation had been done and on what basis. Court queries in this behalf were not answered, which led to the belief that the DDA was suppressing, something and had acted arbitrarily to the prejudice of the writ petitioners. The relevant material had been placed before the larger Bench and the Bench after taking into consideration the material placed before it came to the conclusion that the price fixed by the Lt. Governor of Delhi was neither arbitrary nor illegal. The inconsistency of the views expressed in the impugned judgment and the larger Bench of Delhi High Court it self evident. Delhi High Court has resolved the conflict of views expressed by the Division Bench of co-equal strength by constituting a larger Bench and the special leave filed against the judgment of the larger Bench has already been dismissed.

18. Inconsistency and contradiction in the orders passed by the same Court on the same point regarding the same scheme cannot be allowed to be continued or perpetuated. If contention of the learned counsel is accepted then an anomalous situation would arise by which the price fixed for few of the MIG flats in the scheme would be much less than the price fixed for the remaining flats allotted in the same year which cannot be permitted. The law laid down by the Supreme Court is binding on all courts within the territory of India and the law laid down by a High Court is binding on all courts within its jurisdiction. It is a cardinal principle of rule of law that inconsistency and contradiction in the orders has to be avoided at all costs to bring about a certainty in the mind of the Subordinate courts and the litigant public. This principle would stand violated in case two binding principles on the same point of the same Court are allowed to operate simultaneously.

19. We put an end to the controversy by setting aside the impugned judgment and dispose of the writ petitions filed by the respondents in terms of the order passed by the Full Bench of the Delhi High Court in Sheelawanti & Ors. decided on 3rd February, 1995. We agree with the view expressed by the larger Bench in Sheelawanti & Ors. Case (supra).

20. The appeals, accordingly, stand disposed of with no order as to costs.

Kurian Joseph, J.

1. Leave granted.

2. The scope of this appeal is limited to the challenge on legality of the proceedings Under Section 340 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as ""the Code"") initiated by the High Court as part of the impugned judgment dated 12th/13th April, 2016 in Appeal from Order No. 489 of 2013 on the file of the High Court of Gujarat. The appeal before the High Court arose from an order passed by the Senior Civil Judge, Ahmedabad declining to grant an interim injunction, in Civil Suit No. 28 of 2012. Having extensively referred to the materials on record, the High Court after elaborately considering the arguments, by a detailed judgment, dismissed the appeal, confirming the order passed by the trial court. The Plaintiff/Respondent had also approached this Court by way of a Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 14478 of 2016. The said Special Leave Petition has been dismissed on 15.11.2016 as not pressed on the submission that the parties have reached an amicable settlement on the issue.

3. The High Court, on account of the contradictory stand taken by the Appellant herein who was the first Respondent before the High Court (Defendant No. 1 in the Suit), took the view that the conduct of the Appellant has affected the administration of justice, and therefore, it was expedient in the interests of justice to file a complaint against the Appellant Under Section 340 of the Code.

4. It is necessary to refer to the relevant paragraphs in the judgment where the High Court has dealt with the issue:

19. Before concluding, the Court deems it necessary to take serious view on the conduct of the Respondent No. 1 - Defendant No. 1, who either for an extraneous consideration, or to save his skin, has taken contradictory stands in the judicial proceedings by filing one written statement at Exh. 20 supporting the case of the present Appellant - Plaintiff and subsequently by filing the application at Exh. 43, and other documents in the nature of affidavits supporting the case of the Respondents No. 3 to 5. It appears that the Respondent No. 1 has tried to change his version after the impugned order was passed by the trial Court, just to suit his purpose, misusing and abusing the process of law. The Court is constrained to observe that due to sky-rocketing escalation in the prices of the lands in and around the urban areas, the execution of such illegal agreements at the instance of the owners/power-of-attorney holders/banakhat holders has become rampant, and that more often than not, the proceedings of Courts are being misused and abused to a large extent by such unscrupulous elements. In many cases, innocent persons are being cheated and defrauded by such elements, in the quest of earning easy money, dragging such innocent persons to litigations which go on for years together.

20. In the instant case also, the Respondent No. 1 - Defendant No. 1 after requesting the trial Court to reopen his right to file written statement, and after filing written statement at Exh. 20 along with the affidavit and declaration supporting the case of the Appellant - Plaintiff, had filed an application at Exh. 43, requesting the trial Court to de-exhibit the earlier written statement at Exh. 20 by stating, inter alia, that the said written statement was filed by the Advocate Ms. Trupti Patel on his behalf without his knowledge. The said Application at Exh. 43 was rejected by the trial Court, which order has remained unchallenged. All these documents namely the written statement at Exh. 20 with affidavit and declaration and the other written statement and the affidavit filed before the trial Court have also been produced by the learned Counsels for the parties in the present proceedings and have been relied upon by them, to support their respective contentions. From the said documents on record, it clearly transpires that the Respondent No. 1 - Defendant No. 1 had sought to produce two sets of documents contradictory to each other, in relation to the proceedings in this Court, and had made the declarations and statements which he knew were false, for being used as evidence in the judicial proceedings. The Respondent No. 1 has neither denied his signatures on the written statement Exh. 20 and the affidavit filed along therewith, nor has taken any action against the advocate Ms. Trupti Patel, who had allegedly filed the said written statement on his behalf. The second written statement was sought to be filed along with the application Exh. 43 after the impugned order was passed by the trial Court, and when the present Appeal from Order was pending before this Court. The Court, therefore, has reason to believe that the Respondent No. 1 has deliberately and consciously tried to take Courts for a ride and filed the documents and declarations making false statements which could be read as evidence in the judicial proceedings, and thereby has prima facie acted in the manner which would affect the administration of justice, tantamounting to the offences as contemplated in Section 199 and Section 200 of Indian Penal Code, and as referred in Section 195(1)(b)(i) of Code of Criminal Procedure. As stated herein above, nowadays such illegal transactions and agreements are rampant, and the process of law is being misused and abused by the unscrupulous elements, which ultimately hampers the administration of justice. The Court, therefore, is of the opinion that it is expedient in the interest of justice to file complaint against the Respondent No. 1 in exercise of the powers conferred Under Section 340 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

21. In view of the above, the Appeal from Order is dismissed. The Registrar (Judicial), Gujarat High Court, Ahmedabad is directed to make complaint against the Respondent No. 1 in view of the above findings recorded by the Court for the offence Under Section 199 and Section 200 of Indian Penal Code before the competent Court of Magistrate, having jurisdiction, who shall, after following the procedure as contemplated in Section 343 of Code of Criminal Procedure., deal with the case in accordance with law.

5. It is the main contention of the learned Counsel for the Appellant that while passing the order, as extracted above, the High Court has not followed the procedure contemplated Under Section 340(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Section 340(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads as follows:

340. Procedure in cases mentioned in Section 195.-(1) When, upon an application made to it in this behalf or otherwise, any Court is of opinion that it is expedient in the interests of justice that an inquiry should be made into any offence referred to in Clause (b) of Sub-section (1) of Section 195, which appears to have been committed in or in relation to a proceeding in that Court or, as the case may be, in respect of a document produced or given in evidence in a proceeding in that Court, such Court may, after such preliminary inquiry, if any, as it thinks necessary,-

(a) record a finding to that effect;

(b) make a complaint thereof in writing;

(c) send it to a Magistrate of the first class having jurisdiction;

(d) take sufficient security for the appearance of the accused before such Magistrate, or if the alleged offence is non-bailable and the Court thinks it necessary so to do, send the accused in custody to such Magistrate; and

(e) bind over any person to appear and give evidence before such Magistrate.

6. There are two pre conditions for initiating proceedings Under Section 340 Code of Criminal Procedure - (i) materials produced before the court must make out a prima facie case for a complaint for the purpose of inquiry into an offence referred to in Clause (b)(i) of Sub-section (1) of Section 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and (ii) it is expedient in the interests of justice that an inquiry should be made into the alleged offence.

7. The mere fact that a person has made a contradictory statement in a judicial proceeding is not by itself always sufficient to justify a prosecution Under Sections 199 and 200 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) (hereinafter referred to as ""the Indian Penal Code""); but it must be shown that the Defendant has intentionally given a false statement at any stage of the judicial proceedings or fabricated false evidence for the purpose of using the same at any stage of the judicial proceedings. Even after the above position has emerged also, still the court has to form an opinion that it is expedient in the interests of justice to initiate an inquiry into the offences of false evidence and offences against public justice and more specifically referred in Section 340(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, having regard to the overall factual matrix as well as the probable consequences of such a prosecution. (See K.T.M.S. Mohd. and Anr. v. Union of India MANU/SC/0349/1992MANU/SC/0349/1992 : (1992) 3 SCC 178). The court must be satisfied that such an inquiry is required in the interests of justice and appropriate in the facts of the case.

8. In the process of formation of opinion by the court that it is expedient in the interests of justice that an inquiry should be made into, the requirement should only be to have a prima facie satisfaction of the offence which appears to have been committed. It is open to the court to hold a preliminary inquiry though it is not mandatory. In case, the court is otherwise in a position to form such an opinion, that it appears to the court that an offence as referred to Under Section 340 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been committed, the court may dispense with the preliminary inquiry. Even after forming an opinion as to the offence which appears to have been committed also, it is not mandatory that a complaint should be filed as a matter of course. (See Pritish v. State of Maharashtra and Ors. MANU/SC/0740/2001MANU/SC/0740/2001 : (2002) 1 SCC 253).

9. In Iqbal Singh Marwah and Anr. v. Meenakshi Marwah and Anr. MANU/SC/0197/2005MANU/SC/0197/2005 : (2005) 4 SCC 370, a Constitution Bench of this Court has gone into the scope of Section 340 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Paragraph-23 deals with the relevant consideration:

23. In view of the language used in Section 340 Code of Criminal Procedure the court is not bound to make a complaint regarding commission of an offence referred to in Section 195(1)(b), as the Section is conditioned by the words ""court is of opinion that it is expedient in the interests of justice"". This shows that such a course will be adopted only if the interest of justice requires and not in every case. Before filing of the complaint, the court may hold a preliminary enquiry and record a finding to the effect that it is expedient in the interests of justice that enquiry should be made into any of the offences referred to in Section 195(1)(b). This expediency will normally be judged by the court by weighing not the magnitude of injury suffered by the person affected by such forgery or forged document, but having regard to the effect or impact, such commission of offence has upon administration of justice. It is possible that such forged document or forgery may cause a very serious or substantial injury to a person in the sense that it may deprive him of a very valuable property or status or the like, but such document may be just a piece of evidence produced or given in evidence in court, where voluminous evidence may have been adduced and the effect of such piece of evidence on the broad concept of administration of justice may be minimal. In such circumstances, the court may not consider it expedient in the interest of justice to make a complaint....

10. Having heard the learned Counsel appearing on both sides and having gone through the impugned order and also having regard to the subsequent development whereby the parties have decided to amicably settle some of the disputes, we are of the view that the matter needs fresh consideration. We are also constrained to form such an opinion since it is fairly clear on a reading of the order that the court has not followed all the requirements Under Section 340 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as settled by this Court in the decisions referred to above regarding the formation of the opinion on the expediency to initiate an inquiry into any offence punishable Under Sections 193 to 196 (both inclusive), 199, 200, 205 to 211 (both inclusive) and 228 of the Indian Penal Code, when such an offence is alleged to have been committed in relation to any proceedings before the court. On forming such an opinion in respect of such an offence which appears to have been committed, the court has to take a further decision as to whether any complaint should be made or not.

11. No doubt, such an opinion can be formed even without conducting a preliminary inquiry, if the formation of opinion is otherwise possible. And even after forming the opinion also, the court has to take a decision as to whether it is required, in the facts and circumstances of the case, to file the complaint. Only if the decision is in the affirmative, the court needs to make a complaint in writing and the complaint thus made in writing is then to be sent to a Magistrate of competent jurisdiction.

12. Under Section 343 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Magistrate has to deal with the complaint referred to in Section 340 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as if it was instituted on a police report. Therefore, on the offences referred to Under Section 195(1)(b)(i) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, all falling within the purview of warrant case, the Magistrate has to follow the procedure for trial of warrant cases under Chapter XIX Part A comprising of Sections 238 to 243 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is only in view of such seriousness of the matter, Section 340 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has provided for a meticulous procedure regarding initiation of the inquiry.

13. We find that the court in the impugned order has not followed the procedure in making the opinion that it was expedient in the interests of justice to file a complaint against Respondent No. 1 in exercise of the powers conferred Under Section 340 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and directing the Registrar (Judicial) of the High Court of Gujarat, Ahmedabad ""to make complaint against Respondent No. 1 in view of the findings recorded by the court for the offence Under Sections 199 and 200 of the Indian Penal Code...."". Having regard to the subject matter of the complaint and subsequent developments, we are of the view that in the interests of justice the matter needs to be laid to rest.

14. The appeal is hence allowed. The impugned order to the extent of initiation of the proceedings Under Section 340 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is set aside.

15. There shall be no orders as to costs.

B.P. Singh, J.

1. In this batch of appeals and special leave petitions the common question which arises for consideration is whether the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, particularly Sections 6, 23(2) and 28 there of stand incorporated in the three State Acts with which we are concerned in these matters or whether the Land Acquisition Act has been merely referred to in the State Acts. If it is held that the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act stand legislatively incorporated in the State Acts, the subsequent amendments to the Land Acquisition Act will have no effect upon the acquisitions made under the State Acts. We are concerned with three State Acts, namely, The Punjab Town Improvement Act, 1922 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Punjab Act'); The Nagpur Improvement Trust Act, 1936 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Nagpur Act') and The Uttar Pradesh Avas Evam Vikas Parishad Adhiniyam, 1965 (hereinafter referred to as 'the U.P. Act').

2. C.A. Nos. 9206 to 9214 of 1995; C.A. Nos. 9260-9261 of 1995; C.A. No. 3789 of 1992; SLP (C) No. 12949/1992; SLP (C)No. 3331/1993 & SLP (C) No. 3210/1999 relate to acquisitions made under the Punjab Act. C.A. No. 839 of 1995 and C.A. Nos. 6590 to 6292 of 2001 relate to acquisitions under the U.P. Act while C.A. Nos. 1164-2000 of 1993 and SLP (C) Nos. 8256-8259 of 1993 relate to acquisitions made under the Nagpur Act.

3. In the matters arising under the Punjab Act, the High Court of Punjab and Haryana held that the claimants, whose lands were acquired under the Punjab Act were entitled to additional compensation under Section 23(1-A) of the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984 as also to the solatium under Section 23(2) and interest under Section 28 of the Land Acquisition Act as amended by Act 68 of 1984. The Court relied upon the judgment of this Court in Union of India and Anr. v. Zora Singh and Ors. MANU/SC/0471/1992MANU/SC/0471/1992 : (1992)1SCC673 , Nagpur Improvement Trust and Anr. v. Vithal Rao and Ors. AIR 1973 SC 689 as also the full Bench of that Court in Harbans Kaur and Ors. v. Ludhiana Improvement Trust and Ors. 1973 P.L.J. 250 .

4. In the appeals which relate to the acquisitions under the Nagpur Act, the appellant, namely the Nagpur Improvement Trust, has impugned the judgment and order of the High Court of Bombay (Nagpur Bench), Nagpur, holding that the Land Acquisition Act is merely referred to in the Nagpur Act and, therefore, the provisions of Section 6 including the proviso there to apply to acquisitions under the Nagpur Act. Since the notice under Section 39 of the Nagpur Act corresponding to the Notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act was first published in the official gazette on 25th December, 1969 and the subsequent Notification under Section 45 corresponding to the declaration under Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act was published on 18th September, 1974 i.e. after more than three years, the same deserves to be quashed since the notice published under Section 39 of the Act lapsed on expiry of three years from the date of its publication, and no action pursuant to the said notice could have been taken there after.

5. In Civil Appeal No. 839 of 1995 which arises under the U.P. Act, the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad dismissed the writ petitions challenging the acquisitions before it holding that Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act was legislatively incorporated in the U.P. Act which was of the year 1965, and that the subsequent amendment of Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act in the year 1967 did not affect the provisions of the U.P. Act including Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act as incorporated in the U.P. Act. It, therefore, rejected the contentions urged on behalf of the petitioners that acquisition proceedings lapsed on expiry of the period of three years from the date of issuance of Notification under Section 28 of the U.P. Act which corresponds with Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act. The High Court relied upon its Full Bench decision in Doctors Sahakari Gram Nirman Samiti Ltd. v. Avas and Vikas Parishad etc., MANU/UP/0204/1984MANU/UP/0204/1984 : AIR 1984 All 234 : AIR 1984 All 234 .

6. In Civil Appeal Nos. 6590-6592 of 2001, the sole question is whether the claimants are entitled to interest on the sum payable under Section 23 of the Land Acquisition Act.

7. The Punjab Act was enacted to make provision for the improvement and expansion of towns in Punjab. The Nagpur Act also makes provisions for the improvement and expansion of the town of Nagpur. The U.P. Act has the same objective but applies to whole of the State of Uttar Pradesh, excluding the Cantonment areas. All these State Acts incorporate a similar scheme and follow a common pattern. They provide for the constitution of Trust or Board, as the case may be, and also provide for various schemes for the improvement and expansion of the areas covered by the Act. All the three Acts provide for acquisition of land in accordance with the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act subject to the modifications made there to by the Act and/or the Schedule to the Act. In a nut shell, the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act are made applicable to the acquisitions made under the State Acts subject to certain modifications as indicated in the Act and/or the Schedule there to.

8. Before we advert to the submissions urged at the Bar we may briefly notice the scheme under the said Acts.

9. The Punjab Act provides for the creation and incorporation of Trusts which are charged with the duty of carrying out the provisions of the Act in the local area within their jurisdiction. Provisions have been made for the constitution of the Trusts and the manner in which the proceedings of the Trusts and their Committees are to be conducted. Chapter IV of the Act deals with the schemes which may be framed under the Act, which include general improvement scheme or rebuilding scheme; street schemes and deferred street schemes; development and expansion schemes;housing accommodation scheme; re-housing scheme etc. Under Section 36 of the Act when a Scheme is framed, the Trust shall prepare a notice stating the fact that the scheme has been framed and prescribe the boundaries of the locality comprised in the scheme and furnish requisite particulars. Such a notice is required to be published weekly for three consecutive weeks in the Official Gazette and in a news paper or news papers with a statement of the period within which objections will be received. Under Section 38, during the thirty days next following the first day on which any notice is published under Section 36 in respect of any scheme under the Act, the Trust is required to serve a notice on every person, whom the Trust has reason to believe, to be the owner of any immovable property which it is proposed to acquire in executing the scheme and the occupier of such premises. Under Section 41 the State Government may sanction, either with our without modification or may refuse to sanction, or may return for reconsideration, any scheme submitted to it under Section 40 of the Act. In case scheme is sanctioned by the State Government, Section 42 mandates the State Government to notify the sanction of the scheme under the Act whereafter the Trust shall proceed to execute the scheme in accordance with the provisions of the Act. A notification under Sub-section (1) of Section 42 in respect of any scheme is conclusive evidence that the scheme has been duly framed and sanctioned. Chapter V deals with the powers and duties of the Trust where the scheme has been sanctioned. Chapter VI deals with the acquisition proceedings and the application of the Act to other authorities. Section 56 there under enables the State Government to abandon the acquisition of land in certain cases on payment being made of a sum to be fixed by the Trust. A Tribunal is constituted under Section 58 for the purpose of performing the functions of the Court in reference to the acquisition of land for the Trust under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. Section 59 is of considerable significance and is, therefore, reproduced below:-

""59. Modification of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 -- For the purpose of acquiring land under the Land Acquisition Act, 1984, for the trust-

(a) the tribunal shall (except for the purposes of Section 54 of the said Act) be deemed to be the Court, and the president of the tribunal shall be deemed to be the Judge, under the said Act;

(b) the said Act shall be subject to the further modifications indicated in the Schedule to this Act;

(c) the president of the tribunal shall have power to summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses, and to compel the production of documents by the same means and (so far as may by) in the same manner as is provided in the case of a Civil Court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908; and

(d) the award of a tribunal shall be deemed to be the award of the Court under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, and shall be final"".

10. The Schedule to the Act is also of considerable significance since it seeks to modify the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act in its application to acquisitions under the Punjab Act. Paragraph 2 of the Schedule reads as under:-

""2. Notification under Section 4 and declaration under Section 6 to be replaced by notification under Sections 36 and 42 of this Act. -- (1) The first publication of a notice of any improvement scheme under Section 36 of this Act shall be substituted for and have the same effect as publication in the Official Gazette and in the locality of a notification under Sub-section (1) of Section4 of the said Act, except where a declaration under Section 4 or Section 6 of the said Act has previously been made and is still in force.

(2) Subject to the provisions of Clauses 10 and 11 of this Schedule, the issue of a notice under Sub-section 32(1) of section in the case of land acquired under that sub-section and in any other case the publication of a notification under Section 42 shall be substituted for and have the same effect as a declaration by the State Government under Section 6 of the said Act, unless a declaration under the last mentioned section has previously been made and is still in force"".

11. Various clauses of the schedule seek to amend Sections11, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 31 & 49 of the Land Acquisition Act. Two new provisions have been inserted, namely Sections 24A and 48A. The relevant part of paragraphs 6 and 10 of the schedule which seek to add Section 17-A and modify Section 23 of the Land Acquisition Act are as follows:-

""6. Transfer of land to Trust - After Section17 of the said Act, the following shall be deemed to be inserted, namely:-

17-A. In every case referred to in Section 16or Section 17, the Collector shall, upon payment of the cost of acquisition, make over charge of the land to the trust, and the land shall there upon vest in the trust subject to the liability of the trust to pay any further costs which may be incurred on account of its acquisition"".

""10. Amendment of Section 23. -- (1) In clause first and clause sixthly of Sub-section(1) of Section 23 of the said Act, for the words ""publication of the declaration relating there to under Section 6"" and the words ""publication of the declaration under Section 6"", shall be deemed to be substituted.-

(a) if the land is being acquired under Sub-section (3) of Section 32 of this Act the words ""issue of the notice under Sub-section (3) of Section 32 of the Punjab Town Improvement Act, 1922,"" and

(b) in any other case, the words ""first publication of the notification under Section 36 of the Punjab Town Improvement Act, 1922"".

(2) The full stop at the end of Sub-section(2) of Section 23 of the said Act shall be deemed to be changed to a colon and the following provision shall be deemed to be added:-

Provided that this sub-section shall not apply to any land acquired under the Punjab Town Improvement Act, 1922.""

Section 48A reads as under:-

""48-A. Compensation to be awarded when land not acquired within one year. - (1) If within a period of one year, from the date of the publication of the declaration under Section 6 in respect of any land, the Collector has not made an award under Section 11 with respect to such land, the owner of the land shall, unless he has been to a material extent responsible for the delay, be entitled to receive compensation for the damage suffered by him in consequence of the delay.

(2) The provision of part III of this Act shall apply, so far as it may to the determination of the compensation payable under this section.""

12. The Nagpur Act, namely -- the Nagpur Improvement Trust Act, 1936, follows the same pattern. Chapter II of the Act deals with the Constitution of the Trust and Chapter III deals with the proceedings of the Trust and the Committees. Chapter IV deals with various improvement schemes contemplated by the Act. Section 26 provides that an improvement scheme may provide for all or any of the matters provided there in which includes the acquisition by purchase, exchange, or otherwise of any property necessary for or affected by the execution of the scheme; recovery of betterment contributions; the re-laying out of any land comprised in the scheme, the construction and re-construction of buildings; the provisions of parks, playing-fields and open spaces etc; sanitary arrangements required for the area; reclamation or reservation of land for market, gardens, afforestation etc. It also includes any matter for which, in the opinion of the State Government, it is expedient to make provision with a view to the improvement of any area in question or the general efficiency of the scheme. Various schemes have been specified such as a general improvement scheme; a re-building scheme; a re-housing scheme; a street scheme; a deferred street scheme; a house accommodation scheme etc. Sections 36 to 47 prescribe the procedure to be followed in framing an improvement scheme. Section 39provides that when any improvement scheme has been framed,the Trust shall prepare a notice stating the fact that the scheme has been framed; the boundaries of the area comprised in the scheme and such other particulars as are specified in that section. Under Section 41, during the thirty days next following the first day on which any notice is published under Section 39 in respect of any improvement scheme, the Trust shall serve a notice on every person whose name appears in the Municipal assessment list of land as owner of any building or land which it proposed to acquire in executing the scheme or in regard to which it proposed to recover a betterment contribution. The notice shall state that the Trust propose to acquire such land or to recover such betterment contribution for the purposes of carrying out an improvement scheme. The notice shall call upon such person, if he dissents from such acquisition or from the recovery of such betterment contribution, to state his reason in writing within a period of sixty days from service of the notice. The objections are, thereafter, to be considered under Section 43 within the period prescribed. The objectors are entitled to be heard in the matter if they so desire, whereafter the Trust may either abandon the scheme or apply to the State Government for sanction of the scheme with such modification, if any, as the Trust may consider necessary. Thereafter the State Government may sanction either with or without modification, or may refuse to sanction, or may return for reconsideration, any improvement scheme submitted to it under Section 43, Section 45 provides that whenever the State Government sanctions an improvement scheme, it shall announce the fact by notification and the Trust shall forth with proceed to execute the same. The publication of a notification under Sub-section (1) of Section 45 in respect of any scheme shall be conclusive evidence that the scheme has been duly framed and sanctioned. Section 46 authorises the Trust to alter any improvement scheme after the same has been sanctioned subject to the previous sanction of the State Government, if required. Chapter V of the Act lays down the powers and duties of the Trust where a scheme has been sanctioned. Chapter VI deals with the acquisition and disposal of land. Section 58 provides for acquisition by purchase, lease or exchange by the Trust pursuant to an agreement with the person concerned. Section 59 reads as follows:-

""59. The Trust may, with the previous sanction of the State Government acquire, land under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, as modified by the provisions of this Act, for carrying out any of the purposes of this Act.""

13. Section 60 provides for the constitution of Tribunal for the purposes of performing the functions of the Court in reference to the acquisition of land for the Trust, under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. Section 61 reads as under:-

""61. For the purpose of acquiring land under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, for the Trust.-

(a) the Tribunal shall except for the purposes of Section 54 of that Act, be deemed to be the Court, and the President of the Tribunal shall be deemed to be the Judge there under;

(b) the Act shall be subject to the further modifications as indicated in the Schedule;

(c) the President of the Tribunal may summon witnesses and enforce their attendance and may compel the production of documents by the same means, and so far as may be, in the same manner, as is provided in case of a Civil Court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908; and

(d) the award of the Tribunal shall be deemed to be the award of the Court under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, and shall be final"".

14. It is not necessary to refer to other provisions of the Act. However, the Schedule to the Act provides for further modification of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, Clause 2 and 3 of the Schedule are significant and they are reproduced below:-

""2. (1) The first publication of a notice of an improvement scheme under Section 39 of the Nagpur Improvement Trust Act, 1936, shall be substituted for, and have the same effect as publication in the official Gazette and in the locality of, a notification under Sub-section (1) of Section 4, except where a declaration under Section 4 or Section 6 has previously been made and is still in force.

(2) Subject to the provisions of Clauses 10 and 11 of this Schedule, the issue of notice under Sub-section (4) of Section 32 of the Nagpur Improvement Trust Act 1936, in the case of land acquired under that sub-section, and in any other case the publication of a notification under Section 45 of the Nagpur Improvement Trust Act, 1936, shall be substituted for, and have the same effect as a declaration by the State Government under Section 6, unless a declaration under the last mentioned section has previously been made and is in force.

(3) The full stop at the end of Section 11 shall be deemed to be changed to a semi-colon, and the following shall be deemed to be added, namely:--

""and

(iv) the costs which, in his opinion, should be allowed to any person who is found to be entitled to compensation, and who is not entitled to receive the additional sum of fifteen per centum mentioned in Sub-section(2) of Section 23 as having been actually and reasonably incurred by such person in preparing his claim and putting his case before the Collector.

The Collector may disallow, wholly or in part, costs incurred by any person, if he considers that the claim made by such person for compensation is extravagant.""

15. The Schedule further amends Sections 15, 17, 18, 19, 20,23, 24 & 31 of the Land Acquisition Act. The schedule inserts two new provisions, namely -- Section 24-A and Section 48-A. Section 17-A which has been added by Clause 6 of the Schedule reads as under:-

""6. After Section 17, the following section shall be deemed to be inserted, namely:-

17-A. In every case referred to in Section 16 or Section 17, the Collector shall, upon payment of the cost of acquisition, make over charge of the land to the Trust and the land shall there upon vest in the Trust subject to the liability of the Trust to pay any further costs which may be incurred on account of its acquisition.""

16. Clause 10 of the schedule which effects several modification in Section 23 of the Land Acquisition Act,modifies Sub-section (2) thereof as follows:-

""(2) The full stop at the end of Sub-section(2) of the Section 23 shall be deemed to be changed to a colon, and the following proviso shall be deemed to be added:-

Provided that this sub-section shall not apply to any land acquired under the Nagpur Improvement Trust Act, 1936,except-

(a) buildings in the actual occupation of the owner or occupied free of rent by a relative of the owner, and land appurtenant there to, and

(b) gardens nor let to tenants but used by the owners as a place of resort.""

17. Similar is the scheme under the U.P. Act which has been noticed by this Court in U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad v. Jainul Islam and Anr. MANU/SC/0055/1998MANU/SC/0055/1998 : [1998]1SCR254 : [1998]1SCR254 .

18. It will thus be seen that the three State Acts follow the same pattern and incorporate a common scheme. The provisions of the Land Acquisition Act with certain modifications are made applicable to acquisitions made for purposes of execution of the schemes under those Acts. There is also a striking similarity between schedules to the Punjab and Nagpur Acts, and even though they may not be identical they are in pari materia. The schedule to the U.P. Act is not as detailed but that is due to the fact that many of the modifications in the Land Acquisition Act have been brought about by the provisions of the Act itself. The schedule modifies Sections 17, 23 and 49 of the Land Acquisition Act, and adds a new Section 17-A which is identical to Section 17-A inserted in Punjab and Nagpur Acts. It also gives to the notifications under Section 28(1) and 32(1) of the U.P. Act, the same effect as notifications published under Sections 4 and 6 respectively of the Land Acquisition Act.

19. Mr. Rajinder Sachar, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of Jalandhar Improvement Trust in Civil Appeal No. 9206 of 1995 submitted that a careful analysis of the scheme of the Punjab Act would disclose that the scheme of the Punjab Act is quite different from the scheme of the Land Acquisition Act. Different equities arose under the two Act sand, therefore, the High Court was not justified in holding that even in respect of the acquisition under the Punjab Act, the claimants were entitled to the benefit of beneficial provisions under the Land Acquisition Act as brought in by amending the Land Acquisition Act by Act No. 68 of 1984. He sought to distinguish the judgments relied upon by the respondents and submitted that having regard to the principle laid down by this Court in Maneklal Chhotalal and Ors. v. M.G. Makwana and Ors. MANU/SC/0354/1967MANU/SC/0354/1967 : [1967]3SCR65 : [1967]3SCR65 and State of Gujarat v. Shantilal Mangaldas and Ors. MANU/SC/0063/1969MANU/SC/0063/1969 : [1969]3SCR341 : [1969]3SCR341 , it must be hold that compensation was not justiciable and since the two legislations were under two different entries of the Constitution. Article 14 could not be invoked.

20. Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi, Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of the Nagpur Improvement Trust in C.A. Nos. 1164-1200 of 1993 and the Uttar Pradesh Avas Evam Vikas Parishad in Civil Appeal No. 839 of 1995 submitted that the provisions of the Nagpur and the U.P. Act and the modifications brought about by these Acts leave no room for doubt that the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act stood incorporated by legislation in the State Acts and, therefore, it cannot be said that the legislature intended that subsequent amendments in the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 should apply to an acquisition under the said Act. He further submitted that this Court in Bhatinda Improvement Trust v. Balwant Singh and Ors. MANU/SC/0437/1992MANU/SC/0437/1992 : [1991]3SCR928 : [1991]3SCR928 , over-looked a judgment of this Court in State of Kerala and Ors. v. T.M. Peter and Ors. (1980) 3 SCC534 and erroneously came to the conclusion that there was no question of incorporation of any of the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act in to the Punjab Act. A perusal of the provisions of the Nagpur Act would show that the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 as it stood in 1936 stand incorporated by reference in the 1936 Act subject to the modifications indicated the rein. The Nagpur Act is a complete and exhaustive code enacted with the object of providing for improvement and expansion of the town of Nagpur. The Act also contemplates under Section 58 acquisition by agreement while Sections 59 to 68 deal with compulsory acquisition under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act as modified by the provisions of the Nagpur Act. The Nagpur Act has its own exhaustive mechanism and procedure for acquisition of land and further it adopts provisions of Land Acquisition Act, 1894 as it stood in 1936 with specific, numerous, and detailed modifications which make out a clear case of incorporation of Land Acquisition Act, 1894 as it then stood with modifications. He further contended that it cannot be that the legislature intended that subsequent amendments in the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 should automatically apply to the Nagpur Act.

21. So far as the U.P. Act is concerned. Shri Dwivedi submitted that having regard to the scheme of the Act and the modification to the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, it was also a case of incorporation of the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 as amended in its application to the State of U.P. subject to the modifications contained in the Schedule to the Adhiniyam. A separate exhaustive code exists for acquisition under the Adhiniyam. He, however, submitted that while applying Article 14, the nature of the provision of the enactment under consideration becomes important. Mere absence of a limitation of time period for issuance of a declaration under Section 6 would not imply a breach of Article14 and for this he relied upon the judgment of this Court in State of Kerala and Ors. v. T.M. Peter and Ors. (supra). He further submitted that the provisions pertaining to compensation would be different from the provisions pertaining to the time limit for notifying sanction of the draft scheme. The latter would be a procedural provision which may, indirectly, impact compensation by increasing or decreasing it depending upon the market situation. Therefore, the cases of this court pertaining to compensation being equal to the compensation paid under the Land Acquisition Act in view of Article 14 of the Constitution of India, would have no applicability for invoking the proviso to Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act in respect of the scheme under the Nagpur Act and consequently the principles laid down by this Court in NagpurImprovement Trust and Anr. v. Vithal Rao and Ors.(supra) would not be attracted. He, therefore challenged the correctness of the impugned judgment and order of the High Court of Bombay, Nagpur Bench, Nagpur holding that the proviso to Section 6 applies to acquisition made under the Nagpur Act, 1936 and supported the judgment of the Allahabad High Court holding that the said proviso has no application to the acquisition made under the U.P. Act.

22. Mr. V.A. Mohta, Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of the respondents in C.A. No. 1164-1200 of 1993 and appellants in C.A. No. 839 of 1995 relating to the acquisitions made under the Nagpur Act and the U.P. Act submitted that the questions which arise in these matters are:-

1) Whether the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, as modified, stand incorporated in the said Act?

2) Whether the decision of this Court in Nagpur Improvement Trust v. Vithal Rao (supra) is confined to cases of grant of compensation or whether the said principle would also apply to the issuance of Notifications under Sections 4 and 6 of the Land Acquisition Act? and

3) If it is held that the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act stand incorporated whether it would not fall with in any of the four exceptions enunciated in The State of Madhya Pradesh v. M.V. Narashimhan MANU/SC/0226/1975MANU/SC/0226/1975 : 1975CriLJ1639 : 1975CriLJ1639 .

23. On the first question he relied upon the opinion of Sahai, J. in Gauri Shankar Gaur and Ors. v. State of U.P. and Ors. MANU/SC/0893/1993MANU/SC/0893/1993 : AIR1994SC169 : AIR1994SC169 , but conceded that the said view has not been approved by this Court by a larger Bench in U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad v. Jainul Islam and Anr. MANU/SC/0055/1998MANU/SC/0055/1998 : [1998]1SCR254 : [1998]1SCR254 . He pointed out that even though the Nagpur Improvement Trust v. Vithal Rao (supra) dealt with a matter which was confined to the question of compensation the same principle should apply to cases where the application of proviso to Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act is involved. Lastly he contended that this Court must hold that the provisions of the State Acts were supplemental in nature and are, therefore, covered by the first exception enunciated in State of Madhya Pradesh v. M.V. Narasimhan MANU/SC/0226/1975MANU/SC/0226/1975 : 1975CriLJ1639 : 1975CriLJ1639 .

24. Shri K.C. Jain appearing on behalf of the respondents in C.A. No. 1166 of 1993, an appeal preferred by the Nagpur Improvement Trust, submitted that Section 59 as well as Section 61(b) of the Nagpur Act simply cites refers to the Land Acquisition Act and does not incorporate it referentially. Hence all the amendments made to the Land Acquisition Act must apply automatically. In the alternative he submitted that even if it is assumed that the aforesaid provisions incorporate the Land Acquisition Act as it then existed in the year 1936, it falls in exceptional situations carved out by this Court, namely that it is supplemental the Land Acquisition Act and, therefore, incidence of incorporation shall not follow. He supported the reasoning in Jainul Islam's case (supra) and submitted that no applying the amendment leads to unconstitutionality of the Act. He distinguished the decisions of this Court in Prakash Amichand Shah v. State of Gujarat and Ors. MANU/SC/0292/1985MANU/SC/0292/1985 : AIR1986SC468 : AIR1986SC468 and State of Gujarat v. Shantilal Mangaldas and Ors. (supra) and submitted that those decisions relate to Bombay Town Planning Act and were distinguishable. So far as the instant controversy is concerned according to him it stands clearly covered by the decision of this Court in Nagpur Improvement Trust v. Vithal Rao (supra).

25. Mr. N.N. Goswami, learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents in C.A. No. 9212 of 1995 supported the impugned judgment of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana awarding solatium and interest under the beneficial provisions of the Land Acquisition Act as amended in the year 1984. He relied upon the decision of this Court in Nagpur Improvement Trust v. Vithal Rao (supra) and submitted that the provisions of the Punjab Act will have to be struck down as discriminatory if the claimants are not given benefit of the beneficial provisions of the Land Acquisition Act as amended in the year 1984. He further submitted that the provisions of the Punjab Act also provide for payment of solatium and there is no reason why interest should not be granted to the claimants who would otherwise be granted such interest under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, as amended.

26. Counsel appearing in the matters have adopted the submissions advanced by the learned Senior counsel whose submissions we have noticed above.

27. Numerous decisions have been cited before us by learned counsel appearing for the parties. We do not consider it necessary to refer to all of them because several authorities have been cited for the same proposition. Moreover some of the issues involved appear to be clearly covered by a decision of this Court rendered by a Bench comprising of three judges which is a binding precedent. However, we shall notice such of them as appear relevant for decision of the appeals and special leave petitions before us.

28. At the outset we may dispose of Civil Appeal Nos. 6590 to 6592 of 2001. This Court by its order dated September 19, 2001 has already upheld the contention of the appellants that they are entitled to interest on the amount envisaged in Section 23(2) of the Land Acquisition Act. In these three appeals, therefore, the sole question that survive for consideration is whether the appellants whose lands have been acquired under the L"
"

1. We have heard learned counsel.

2. There was a difference of opinion between two Members of the Tribunal and the matter was referred to the President. The difference of opinion arose because of the findings of the Vice President of the Tribunal that the principles of natural justice had not been observed and that the assessee had suffered thereby. The President, however, did not agree and he held that there had been no request by the assessee to cross-examine the representatives of the two concerns to show that the goods in question had been accounted for in their books of account and appropriate duty had been paid. He also observed that he failed to understand the logic behind the request for cross-examination. We find that, in the reply to the show cause notice, the assessee had specifically asked to be allowed to cross-examine the representatives of these two concerns to establish that the goods in question had been accounted for in their books of account and the appropriate amount of Central excise duty had been paid. The logic of such request is clear from what is Stated therein.

3. It is now not contested that the matter should go back to the assessing authority, who shall hear the matter de novo after ensuring that lacunae pointed out in the order of the Vice President are met.

4. The civil appeals are allowed. The order under appeal and the orders of the authorities below are set aside. The matter shall stand restored to the Additional Collector, Okhla to proceed as indicated above.

5. No order as to costs.

1. This Court on 23.09.2016, while entertaining the petition Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India, recorded as follows:

It is further submitted by Mr. Panday that if the investigation and trial takes place in the Siwan District in the State of Bihar, the Respondent Nos. 3 and 4 and the other accused persons will terrorise the witnesses as a consequence of which the Petitioner would not get any justice and remain a constant victim searching for solace. On a perusal of the petition, it is prima facie discernible that the Petitioner who lives with two small children, after losing her husband and the developments that have taken place in the District Siwan, is in a state of continuous fear. It has been said that courage is the mother of all virtues and a man with courage can always sustain his or her dignity. But, sometimes, situations are created by certain powerful protagonists which instil fear in the mind of a citizen and that fear has the potentiality to usher in atrophy to the sense of dignity. It is also asserted in the petition that in the obtaining fact situation, this Court may direct for giving her protection by the competent authority failing which it is difficult to fathom, what kind of danger shall visit her.

Issue notice returnable within two weeks. A copy of the petition be served on Mr. Gopal Singh, learned standing Counsel for the State of Bihar who shall obtain instructions from Respondent Nos. 1 and 2. As far as Respondents 3 and 4 are concerned, Mr. Gopal Singh shall instruct the Respondent No. 1, the Home Secretary of the State of Bihar to see to it that the Respondent Nos. 3 and 4 are served dasti. As far as Respondent No. 2 is concerned, a copy be served on Mr. Gopal Singh, apart from dasti.

As far as the CBI is concerned, let a copy of the petition be served on Mr. P.K. Dey, learned Counsel, who ordinarily appears for CBI so that he can take instructions.

In course of hearing, Mr. Pandaya submitted that the CBI has not commenced the investigation. In view of that, we direct that the CBI may proceed with the investigation but not finalize it and shall file the status report before this Court on 17.10.2016.

The Superintendent of Police, Siwan District shall provide police protection to the Petitioner and her family. The concerned Station House Officer of Nagar Thana shall also see that the protection is given. We have directed both the Superintendent of Police and the Station House Officer so that the Petitioner, a lady in distress, shall feel protected.

Be it noted, on that day, a statement was made by Mr. Kisley Pandey, learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner that Mohammad Kaif had surrendered to custody on 21.09.2016 and the other accused Mohammad Javed was still absconding. An affidavit has been filed by the State of Bihar contending, inter alia, that the charge sheet has been filed against six accused persons including both the abovenamed persons on 20.08.2016.

2. As per our earlier order, a status report by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has been filed. The relevant part of the report reads as under:

5. That immediately after registration of the Case by CBI, a team headed by SP, CBI along with Chief IO, Assistant IO and other support staff reached Siwan on 16.09.2016 and has been coming there for the purposes of expeditious Investigation.

6. That the CBI team inspected the scene of crime and other relevant places in attendance of the IOs of the local police and also discussed the details of the case and collected relevant information.

7. That the CBI team collected the case files/records from local police. Scrutiny of the records revealed that Siwan Police had filed charge sheet against six accused persons namely Azaharuddin Beig @ Laddan Miyan, Rohit Kumr Soni, Vijay Kumar Gupta, Rajesh Kumar, Sonu Kumar Gupta and Rishu Kumar Jaiswal in the court of CJM, Siwan on 20.08.2016. However, they had kept open further investigation in the matter.

8. That scrutiny of the local police records also revealed that the suspect Sonu Kumar Soni, Mohammad Kaif @ Bunty, Javed and Jimmy were absconding after the registration of case by local police.

9. That the CBI after collecting the records had taken following steps:

(i) The local police records which were illegible were typed clearly.

(ii) The exhibits including arms and ammunition, clothes of the deceased, mobile instruments of the accused persons and deceased were collected. The mobile instruments were sent to the expert for retrieving the data including deleted data.

(iii) CFSL team from New Delhi were called and scene of crime was recreated with the help of local police IOs and the persons who had seen the body and the place of occurrence.

(iv) Interaction with the Doctors who had conducted Postmortem of the deceased was made in presence of CFSL expert.

(v) Call details of the accused, suspect, deceased and other relevant person were collected which are under scrutiny.

(vi) The hard disk of computer being used by the deceased was collected and sent to the expert to find any relevant material to the case.

(vii) Around 40 witnesses were examined which included the complaint and his family members, IOs associated with the case, Doctors who conducted post morten, Persons connected with print media and others to know the details and motive for killing the deceased.

(viii) So far two suspect/accused Sonu Kumar Soni and Mohammad Kaif @ Bunty were taken on police remand and interrogated in depth.

(ix) The accused Azaharuddin Beig @ Laddan Miyan was examined in Judicial Custody in Central Jail Gaya.

(x) The suspect Javed has surrendered in other case and will soon be examined in the instant case.

3. On being asked, for what offences, the charge sheet has been filed, learned Counsel for the State could not mention the same. However, Ms. Pinky Anand, learned Additional Solicitor General and Mr. P.K. Dey, learned Counsel appearing for the CBI, after obtaining instructions from Mr. S.S. Kishore, S.P., CBI, stated that charge sheet has been filed Under Sections 302/34 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code and for the offences Under Sections 25 and 27 of the Arms Act. As already stated, we have directed investigation by the CBI and, therefore, the CBI is investigating and the CBI investigation shall continue.

4. The issue that we have posed on the earlier occasion whether the two accused persons, namely, Mohammad Kaif and Mohammad Javed who have criminal antecedents and were declared as proclaimed offenders were seen in the company of Respondent No. 3 and Respondent No. 4, namely, Shahabuddin, Vice President, Rashtriya Janta Dal and Tej Pratap Yadav, Health Minister, Government of Bihar, could have been allowed to do so. It is submitted by Mr. Surendra Singh, learned Senior Counsel appearing for Respondent No. 4 and Mr. Shoeb Alam, learned Counsel appearing for Respondent No. 3 that there were chance meetings and, in any case, the accused are not proclaimed offenders. Mr. Gopal singh, learned Counsel appearing for the State of Bihar would contend that they are not proclaimed offenders on the date they were seen in the company of Respondent Nos. 3 and 4 giving bouquets.

5. Having regard to the entire scenario, we are inclined to issue three directions at present:

1. The learned Sessions Judge, Siwan (Town), Bihar, shall submit a report along with the order sheet with regard to the status of Mohammad Kaif and Mohammad Javed as regards they are proclaimed offenders or whether there was issue of non-bailable warrants of arrest from the court or any other aspect relating to the case concerned.

2. The CBI shall complete the investigation within three months hence.

3. As the charge sheet has already been filed by the State Police and further investigation is in progress by the CBI, the accused persons who have been charge sheeted shall not claim any benefit for enlargement on bail under proviso to Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

6. Let the matter be listed on 28.11.2016 by which date the learned Sessions Judge shall submit the report. The CBI shall also file its further status report by that day.

7. Parties are at liberty to file additional affidavits. Call on the date fixed.

Kurian Joseph, J.

1. Leave granted in Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 12495 of 2015. Around 46.93 acres of Land was acquired by the Respondent- State of Haryana initiating the proceedings by Notification dated 19.09.1983 issued Under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The purpose of acquisition is residential and commercial for Panchkula, Sector-21. The acquired property is in Village Fatehpur. In respect of the same development, we have seen that this Court in many cases has based the fixation of the land value based on acquisition proceedings initiated in 1981 in Village Judian. Those properties in village Judian had access to State Highway and the value fixed by this Court is Rs. 250/- per square yard. In respect of properties situated in the adjoining village of the Appellants namely, Devi Nagar, we have fixed land value at the rate of Rs. 250/- per square yard that was the acquisition initiated in the year 1987 and that property had extensive national highway frontage.

2. Learned Counsel for the Appellants submitted that in all the adjoining villages for the properties acquired for the same purpose, this Court having fixed the land value at Rs. 250/- per square yard and above, the Appellants may also be granted the same value.

3. Shri Sanjay Kumar Tyagi, learned Additional Advocate General for the Respondent-State of Haryana however points out that even according to the Appellants, their claim was only Rs. 125/- per square yard and in any case the land of the Appellants does not have the same advantage when compared to other properties for which this Court had fixed the land value at Rs. 250/- per square yard and above.

4. Learned Counsel appearing for the Appellants however points out that in the matter of fixation of just and fair compensation, the Court is not bound by claim made by the owner. It is for the Court, in the facts and circumstances of each case, to award just and fair compensation.

5. Prior to amendment Act 68 of 1984, the amount of compensation that could be awarded by the Court was limited to the amount claimed by the applicant. Section 25 read as under-

Section 25. Rules as to amount of compensation-

(1) When the applicant has made a claim to compensation, pursuant to any notice given Under Section 9, the amount awarded to him by the court shall not exceed the amount so claimed or be less than the amount awarded by the Collector Under Section 11.

(2) When the applicant has refused to make such claim or has omitted without sufficient reason (to be allowed by the Judge) to make such claim, the amount awarded by the court shall in no case exceed the amount awarded by the Collector.

(3) When the applicant has omitted for a sufficient reason (to be allowed by the Judge) to make such claim, the amount awarded to him by the court shall not be less than, and may exceed, the amount awarded by the Collector.

The amended Section 25 reads as Under:

Section 25. Amount of compensation awarded by Court not to be lower than the amount awarded by the Collector- The amount of compensation awarded by the Court shall not be less than the amount awarded by the Collector Under Section 11.

The amendment has come into effect on 24.09.1984.

6. The pre-amended provision put a cap on the maximum; the compensation by court should not be beyond the amount claimed. The amendment in 1984, on the contrary, put a cap on the minimum; compensation cannot be less that what was awarded by the Land Acquisition Collector. The cap on maximum having been expressly omitted, and the cap that is put is only on minimum, it is clear that the amount of compensation that a court can award is no longer restricted to the amount claimed by the applicant. It is the duty of the Court to award just and fair compensation taking into consideration the true market value and other relevant factors, irrespective of the claim made by the owner.

7. Although in the context of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, this Court in Sanjay Batham v. Munna Lal Parihar MANU/SC/1280/2011MANU/SC/1280/2011 : (2010) 11 SCC 665 held that-

17. It is true that in the petition filed by him Under Section 166 of the Act, the Appellant had claimed compensation of Rs. 4,20,000/- only, but as held in Nagappa v. Gurudayal Singh MANU/SC/1107/2002MANU/SC/1107/2002 : (2003) 2 SCC 274, in the absence of any bar in the Act, the Tribunal and for that reason any competent Court is entitled to award higher compensation to the victim of an accident.

8. In Bhag Singh and Ors. v. Union Territory of Chandigarh MANU/SC/0265/1985MANU/SC/0265/1985 : (1985) 98 L.W. 725 : (1985) 3 SCC 737, this Court held that there may be situations where the amount higher than claimed may be awarded to the claimant. The Court observed

3. ..It must be remembered that this was not a dispute between two private citizens where it would be quite just and legitimate to confine the claimant to the claim made by him and not to award him any higher amount than that claimed though even in such a case there may be situations where an amount higher than that claimed can be awarded to the claimant as for instance where an amount is claimed as due at the foot of an account. Here was a claim made by the Appellants against the State Government for compensation for acquisition of their land and under the law, the State was bound to pay to the Appellants compensation on the basis of the market value of the land acquired and if according to the judgments of the learned single Judge and the Division Bench, the market value of the land acquired was higher than that awarded by the Land Acquisition Collector or the Additional District Judge, there is no reason why the Appellants should have been denied the benefit of payment of the market value so determined. To deny this benefit to the Appellants would tantamount to permitting the State Government to acquire the land of the Appellants on payment of less than the true market value. There may be cases where, as for instance, under agrarian reform legislation, the holder of land may, legitimately, as a matter of social justice with a view to eliminating concentration of land in the hands of a few and bringing about its equitable distribution, be deprived of land which is not being personally cultivated by him or which is in excess of the ceiling area with payment of little compensation or no compensation at all, but where land is acquired under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, it would not be fair and just to deprive the holder of his land without payment of the true market value when the law, in so many terms, declares that he shall be paid such market value.

9. In Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti v. Kanhaiya Lal MANU/SC/0625/2000MANU/SC/0625/2000 : (2000) 7 SCC 756, this Court held that under the amended provisions of Section 25 of the Act, the Court can grant a higher compensation than claimed by the applicant in his pleadings-

17. Award being in this case between the dates 30th April, 1982 and 24th September, 1984 and as per the Union of India and Anr. v. Raghubir Singh (Dead) by LRs. etc. (supra), the amended provisions would be applicable under which there is no restriction that award could only be upto the amount claimed by the claimant. Hence High Court order granting compensation more than what is claimed cannot be said to be illegal or contrary to the provisions of the Act. Hence the review itself, as is confined for the aforesaid reasons, has no merit.

10. Further, in Bhimasha v. Special Land Acquisition Officer and Ors. MANU/SC/8775/2008MANU/SC/8775/2008 : (2008) 10 SCC 797, a three-Judge bench reiterated the principle in Bhag Singh (supra) and rejected the contention that a higher compensation than claimed by the owner in his pleadings cannot be awarded by the Court. In that case, the High Court had concluded that although the market price of the land was Rs. 66,550/- per acre, since the Appellant had only claimed compensation at the rate of Rs. 58,500/- per acre in his pleadings, therefore he could only be awarded compensation limited to his claim. This Court, while reversing the decision of the High Court, awarded the Petitioner the market value, i.e., Rs. 66,550/- per acre thereby holding that the award would not be limited to the claim made by him.

11. In the case of the Appellants herein, it is an admitted position that the properties do not abut the national highway. Admittedly, it is situated about 375 yards away from the national highway and it appears that there is only the narrow Nahan Kothi Road connecting the properties of the Appellants to the national highway. Therefore, it will not be just and proper to award land value of Rs. 250/- per square yard, which is granted to the property in adjoining village. Having regard to the factual and legal position obtained above, we are of the considered view that the just and fair compensation in the case of Appellants would be Rs. 200/- per square yard. Therefore, these appeals are disposed off fixing the land value at Rs. 200/- per square yard and the Appellants shall also be entitled to all the statutory benefits. The amount as above shall be paid and deposited after adjusting the deficit court fee, if any, before the Executing Court within a period of three months from today.

Abhay Manohar Sapre, J.

1. Civil Appeal Nos. 6101, 6102, 6103 and 6104 of 2009 are filed by the State against the common judgment dated 15.06.2007 passed by the High Court of Himachal Pradesh at Shimla in Civil Writ Petition Nos. 586 of 1999, 66, 118 and 170 of 2000 wherein the High Court allowed the writ petitions filed by the State employees working in the Forest Department by setting aside the judgment/order dated 15.12.1999 passed by the Himachal Pradesh Administrative Tribunal, Shimla in O.A. Nos. 35 of 1989, 595, 609 and 620 of 1990.

2. So far as Civil Appeal Nos. 6097-6100 of 2009 are concerned, these appeals are filed by one set of employees after obtaining leave of this Court because they were not parties before the High Court or before the Tribunal. According to them, consequent upon the declaration given by the High Court in favour of the Respondents in their absence, they felt aggrieved and hence filed these appeals.

3. In order to appreciate the issue involved in these appeals, which lie in a narrow compass, it is necessary to state the relevant facts infra.

4. The Respondents herein are the State employees working in the Forest Department in Himachal Pradesh. They were appointed during 1989-1990 and accordingly posted as ""Range Officers"" in the Forest Department. Their service conditions are governed by the Recruitment & Promotion Rules for the Himachal Pradesh Forest Service (Class-II) (in short ""the Rules"").

5. The Respondents, however, claimed that they having qualified the State Forest Service Course (Diploma Course) from different colleges were eligible to be posted as ACF (Assistant Conservator of Forest) and accordingly were eligible for being treated as ""direct recruits"" in the H.P. Forest Services Class II.

6. The Respondents claimed the aforementioned reliefs essentially on the basis of one letter dated 28.07.1983 sent by the Director of Forest Education, Forest Research Institute & College to the Secretary, Forest Department, States/U. Ts. According to the Respondents, the letter was in the nature of the promise given to them by the State and since the State declined to grant the reliefs, they filed O. As before the H.P. State Administrative Tribunal (for short ""the Tribunal"") against the State and sought for the following reliefs:

(i) That the Respondents may be directed to appoint Petitioner Nos. 1 and 2 as HPFS-II from the date they completed the SFS Training Course from SFS College Dehradum, i.e. April 1, 1986, the day following the convocation.

(ii) That the Respondents may be directed to appoint Petitioner No. 3 as H.P.F.S.-II from the date of his joining the SFS Training Course at SFS College Burnihat, i.e., 1.11.1986.

(iii) That the Petitioners may be declared to have been duly selected for SFS Diploma against direct quota under the existing R & P Rules and the Respondents may be directed to appoint the Petitioners from the due dates as has been done in the cases of their contemporary direct recruits.

(iv) That the Petitioners may be held entitled to all consequential benefits including fixation of seniority and back wages; and

(v) That in the alternative if it is construed that there are some impediments for considering the Petitioners for appointments to HPFS-II from due dates, in that event, the Respondents may be directed to take necessary steps for doing the needful and if the proposed action/rules create certain difficulties in the cases of Petitioners, the same may be deemed to have been relaxed in view of peculiar facts of this case.""

7. The State contested the Respondents' claim and contended that no promise was ever given to the Respondents and nor any promise was discernible from the letter dated 28.07.1983 relied on by the Respondents so as to entitle them to claim the aforementioned reliefs. It was also contended that since the Rules do not make any provision on the issue in question and hence it is not possible to consider grant of such relief to the Respondents. Lastly, it was contended that as and when any amendment in the Rules is made, the cases of the Respondents and Ors. alike them would be considered on their merits at the appropriate stage.

8. The Tribunal, by judgment/order dated 15.12.1999 dismissed the O. As filed by the Respondents. It was held that the letter dated 28.07.1983 does not give any right to the Respondents to claim such reliefs. It was also held that no case of promissory estoppel, as was sought to be pressed in service by the Respondents, was made out in their favour on the strength of the letter dated 28.07.1983. It was also held that the cases of Respondents are governed by the Rules and so long as they do not fulfill the requirements of the Rules, no benefit can be extended to them.

9. Aggrieved by the said judgment/order, the Respondents filed writ petitions Under Article 227 of the Constitution of India in the High Court. By impugned judgment/order, the Division Bench allowed the Respondents' writ petitions and quashed the order of the Tribunal. It was held that a case of promissory estoppel as pleaded by the Respondents is made out against the State. It was held that if the State has failed to amend the Rules, no blame can be attributed to the Respondents for such lapse on the part of the State and nor can they be deprived of their legitimate rights to claim the reliefs for which they filed O. As before the Tribunal.

10. Accordingly, the High Court gave the following declaration in favour of the Respondents:

We consequently allow the writ petitions, set-aside the orders of the learned Tribunal dated 15th December 1999 and hold that the Petitioners are entitled to be inducted in the H.P. State Forest Service-II with effect from the date they successfully completed the State Forest Service Course (Diploma Course) in Forestry with all consequential benefits. No order as to costs.

11. It is against this order, the State filed C.A. Nos. 6101, 6102, 6103 and 6104 of 2009 and the affected State employees, who were not parties before the High Court or the Tribunal filed C.A. Nos. 6097-6100 of 2009.

12. The question which arises for consideration in these appeals is whether the High Court was justified in allowing the writ petitions by granting declaration in favour of the Respondent-employees.

13. Learned Counsel for the Appellant-State while assailing the legality and correctness of the impugned order made two-fold submissions. In the first place, learned Counsel contended that the High Court erred in holding that a case of promissory estoppel was made out in favour of the Respondents. According to him, neither any promise was given by the State and nor it could be spelt out from the contents of the letter dated 28.07.1983. Learned Counsel contended that apart from the letter dated 28.07.1983, the Respondents did not place reliance on any evidence to support their plea of promissory estoppel. Learned Counsel further contended that the plea of promissory estoppel was not applicable to the case in hand for the simple reason that service conditions of the Respondents are governed by the Service Rules. In the second place, learned Counsel contended that the matter is under consideration for making appropriate amendment in the R & P Rules of HPFS-II and hence so long as appropriate amendment is not made, the Respondents are not entitled to claim reliefs.

14. In contra, the Respondents supported the impugned order and contended that no case is made out to interfere in the impugned order and hence the appeals are liable to be dismissed.

15. Having heard the learned Counsel for the parties and on perusal of the record of the case, we find force in the submission of the learned Counsel for the Appellant-State.

16. As mentioned above, the High Court allowed the Respondents' writ petitions essentially on the ground that a case of promissory estoppel was made out against the State and hence the State is bound by the promise made to the Respondents for grant of reliefs in question.

17. We cannot concur with the view taken by the High Court, as in our considered opinion, it is not sustainable both on facts and in law.

18. It is a settled principle of law that the service conditions of a State employee are governed by the Statutory Rules framed by the State from time to time. An employee is, therefore, entitled to enforce his statutory right recognized in the Rules in relation to his service condition if it is breached due to any action on the part of the State. A plea of promissory estoppel can be set up by a person against the State only when he is able to prove with adequate evidence that the State has promised him in writing in express terms to grant specific benefit and acting upon such promise he has altered his position. In such situation, the State cannot be allowed to go back to the promise made to such person and he can enforce the promise made to him.

19. Coming to the facts of the case in hand, we find that firstly the terms and conditions of the service of the Respondents are governed by the Recruitment & Promotion Rules known as R & P Rules of HPFS-II. Secondly, Column 7 of the Schedule to the Rules provides for educational and other qualifications required for direct recruits, whereas Column 10 of the Schedule to the Rules provides for method of recruitment whether by direct or by promotion or transfer. Likewise, Column 11 of the Schedule to the Rules provides for the necessary qualification for promotion etc. Thirdly, the Respondents were not able to show any Rule, which enabled them to claim a relief of the nature for which the O. As were filed. Fourthly, perusal of the letter dated 28.07.1983 would go to show that it only provided that the Forest Rangers, who passed the Ranger Course with Honours, were considered eligible to secure admission to the 2nd year of the State Forest Services Course (Diploma Course) in Forestry being conducted at the State Forest Service Colleges and such deserving Forest Rangers if found suitable, could be considered for admission in the State Forest Services Course.

20. For ready reference, letter dated 28.07.1983 is reproduced hereinbelow:

No. 1410/83-DEF/5-2-62(PT. III)

GOVERNMENT OF INDIA

FOREST RESEARCH INSTITUTE & COLLEGES,

P.O. NEW FOREST, DEHRADUN-248 006

DATED THE 28TH JULY, 1983.

From

The Director of Forest Education

Forest Research Institute & College.

To

The Secretary,

Forest Departments,

States/U. Ts.

Sub: Selection for Diploma Course in Forestry at the State Forest Service Colleges located at Burmihat, Coimbatore and Dehradun.

Sir,

I have the honour to state that in view of the decision taken by the Council of Forestry Research and Education in one of its meeting held at Delhi on 5.5.1983, the Government of India have been pleased to convey their approval to the fact that those trained Forest Rangers who have/had passed the Rangers Course with honours are eligible for admission to the 2nd year of the State Forest Service Course (Diploma Course) in Forestry being conducted at the State Forest Service Colleges located at Bumihat (Assam-Meghalaya), Coimbatore(Tamil Nadu) and Dehradun. It is requested that the matter may kindly be given wide publicity and the cases of deserving trained Forest Rangers may be considered and recommended accordingly for admission in the State Forest Service Course.

Yours faithfully,

Sd/-

Director of Forest Education

Forest Research Institute & Colleges.

Copy forwarded to the Chief Conservator of Forests,......... for favour of information and similar action.

(C.S. Kirpekar)

Director of Forest Education

Forest Research Institute & Colleges.

The contents of the letter quoted above, in our opinion, could not be construed as being in the nature of promise made by the State to the Respondents, so as to enable them to seek its enforcement on the plea of promissory estoppel. The letter, in our view, only prescribed additional qualification enabling the Forest Rangers to seek admission in the State Forest Service Course provided they also fulfill necessary qualifications prescribed in Column 11 of the Schedule to the Rules.

21. In our considered opinion, the High Court, therefore, committed an error in placing reliance on the judgments of this Court rendered in Collector of Bombay v. Municipal Corporation of the City of Bombay and Ors. MANU/SC/0001/1951MANU/SC/0001/1951 : AIR 1951 SC 469, Union of India and Ors. v. Anglo Afghan Agencies etc. MANU/SC/0021/1967MANU/SC/0021/1967 : AIR 1968 SC 718, Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. v. The State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors. MANU/SC/0336/1978MANU/SC/0336/1978 : AIR 1979 SC 621, Surya Narain Yadav and Ors. v. Bihar State Electricity Board and Ors. MANU/SC/0233/1985MANU/SC/0233/1985 : (1985) 3 SCC 38 and State of Punjab v. Nestle India Ltd. and Anr. MANU/SC/0500/2004MANU/SC/0500/2004 : (2004) 6 SCC 465, which dealt with the cases of promissory estoppel. The High Court failed to see the distinction between the facts of the case in hand and the facts which were subject matter of the cases relied on. The case in hand being a service matter, the rights of the parties were required to be decided in the light of the statutory service Rules applicable to the parties. So far as the decisions relied on by the High Court were concerned, those were the cases where this Court laid down the law relating to the promissory estoppel operating in general field inter se citizen and the State. None of these decisions dealt with the cases arising out of service law. The principle of promissory estoppel laid down therein, therefore, could not be applied to the case in hand for giving benefit to the Respondents.

22. Learned Counsel for the Respondents referring to certain letters, contended that a case of promissory estoppel was made out against the State entitling the Respondents to claim the reliefs. We find no force in this submission.

23. We have perused the contents of the letters referred to in the impugned order and find that firstly, the letters were exchanged between one State Authority to other and not addressed to the Respondents and secondly, no enforceable right of the nature in question was created in Respondents' favour on the strength of these letters.

24. Learned Counsel for the Respondents then urged that Appellants in Civil Appeal Nos. 6097-6100 of 2009 have no locus to file the appeal as none of their service rights were adversely affected. This submission need not to be gone into on its merits in this appeal in the light of the decision rendered in C.A. Nos. 6101, 6102, 6103 and 6104 of 2009-appeals filed by the State against the impugned judgment/order.

25. Learned Counsel for the Respondents, lastly, brought to our notice that pending appeals, the Respondents were given some benefits independent to the impugned judgment/order. If that be so, then we prefer to express no opinion on any such issue because it was not gone into at any stage of the proceedings. We, however, make it clear that we only examined the issue which was decided by the Tribunal and the High Court, therefore, this order would not come in the way of the parties if, in the meantime, they or anyone received any benefit independent of the controversy involved in this case. Needless to say, so far as this case is concerned, the cases of the Respondents can always be considered for their promotion etc. in the light of existing Rules if they fulfill the qualifications laid down or as per any amended Rules, if made.

26. In the light of foregoing discussion, we cannot uphold the judgment/order passed by the High Court which deserves to be set aside.

27. The appeals thus succeed and are hereby allowed. The impugned judgment/order dated 15.06.2007 passed by the High Court in the writ petitions is set aside. The writ petitions filed by the Respondents stand dismissed resulting in restoration of the order passed by the Tribunal, which rightly dismissed the O. As filed by the Respondents.

28. In the light of the decision in C.A. Nos. 6101, 6102, 6103 and 6104 of 2009, C.A. Nos. 6097-6100 of 2009 are disposed of.

Dipak Misra, J.

1. A two-Judge Bench while dealing with the interpretation of provisions of Sections 33C(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (for short, ""the Act"") vis--vis a Voluntary Retirement Scheme framed by the State of Andhra Pradesh noticed that the conclusion arrived at by the Division Bench of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh in Writ Appeal No. 820 of 2005, whereby it had given the stamp of approval to the judgment and order dated 21st March, 2005, passed by the learned Single Judge of the said Court in Writ Petition No. 4196 of 2005, holding, inter alia, that once the workmen had availed the Voluntary Retirement Scheme and received the special compensation package, they could not have put forth a claim for lay-off compensation Under Section 33C(2) of the Act and in that context perceived a discordant note in National Buildings Construction Corporation v. Pritam Singh Gill and Ors. MANU/SC/0435/1972MANU/SC/0435/1972 : (1972) 2 SCC 1 and A.K. Bindal and Anr. v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0349/2003MANU/SC/0349/2003 : (2003) 5 SCC 163 and thereafter scanning the anatomy of the Act, referred the matter to a larger Bench in A. Satyanarayana Reddy and Ors. v. Presiding Officer, Labour Court, Guntur and Ors. MANU/SC/2476/2008MANU/SC/2476/2008 : (2008) 5 SCC 280 by stating thus:

The right of the workman to claim payment of lay off compensation is not denied or disputed. If the said claim has no nexus with the Voluntary Retirement Scheme, in our opinion, in a given case, like the present one, it is possible to hold that a proceeding Under Section 33C(2) of the Act would be maintainable. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the question being one of some importance should be considered by the larger Bench as there exists an apparent conflict in the said decisions in National Buildings Construction Corporation (supra) and A.K. Bindal (supra).

Because of the aforesaid order, the matter has been placed before us.

2. The expose of facts are that the Appellants were employees of Nagarjuna Cooperative Sugars Limited (for short, ""the Company""), a Government of Andhra Pradesh undertaking. It was declared as a ""relief undertaking"" in terms of the A.P. Relief Undertaking (Special Provisions) Act, 1971 (for brevity, ""the 1971 Act""). As is evident, the management of the industrial undertaking declared lay-off wherefore compensation was to be paid. The employees-union of the Company preferred a writ petition in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh assailing the Memorandum No. 25027/SUG/A2/97-3 dated 5th January, 1998, whereunder the workmen were not granted compensation and, in fact, were deprived of the same. It was urged by the workmen that the lay-off compensation was paid only for the months of June and July, 1995, though they were entitled to get the said compensation for the period 01.08.1995 to 06.09.2002.

3. When the matter stood thus, the State of Andhra Pradesh transferred the Company to one S.C.M. Sugars Limited, which absorbed some of the workmen, and out of the said absorbed employees, some of them were paid lay-off compensation and some were not extended the benefit. Be it stated, at one point of time all the employees had expressed their willingness to continue to work under the transferee-management. At a later stage, the Government of Andhra Pradesh allowed the said transferee-Company to shift the factory to the State of Karnataka, as a consequence of which, the workmen lost the opportunity to continue to be employed.

4. As the factual matrix would unfurl, the Government of Andhra Pradesh issued G.O. Ms. No. 25 dated 21st May, 2001, provided for a special compensation package for the employees. The condition that was incorporated in the package was to the effect that the amount of compensation was to be paid to the workmen only in the event if they had not opted for employment with the transferee Company. We shall refer to the Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) at a later stage.

5. As the factual score would further undrape, the Appellants opted for voluntary retirement and they were paid the amount of special compensation in terms of the VRS. It is apposite to note here that as the said scheme did not make any provision for payment of lay-off compensation, the Appellants moved the High Court Under Article 226 of the Constitution of India by preferring Writ Petition No. 16916 of 1998. The relief sought in the writ petition was resisted by the transferee Company urging that the workmen having accepted the benefits under the VRS and there had been cessation of relationship between the employer and employee, the writ petition was not maintainable and the relief sought in the writ petition could not be acceded to. The learned Single Judge upon hearing the learned Counsel for the parties opined that it would be appropriate for the writ Petitioners to approach the Industrial Tribunal and work out their remedies by way of a claim petition and by leading appropriate evidence before the said Court. The High Court, be it noted, granted liberty to the workmen to raise all issues which were available including those which had been raised in the writ petition, and accordingly disposed of the writ petition.

6. In pursuance of the aforesaid order, the workmen filed a petition Under Section 33C(2) of the Act claiming lay-off compensation before the Presiding Officer, Labour Court, Guntur that formed the subject matter of C.F.R. No. 4319/2004 III Un-No. M.P./2004. The Labour Court dismissed the application as not maintainable on the foundation that the claimants were not workmen Under Section 2(s) of the Act having received all the benefits under VRS. Aggrieved by the aforesaid order of the Labour Court, the Appellants herein preferred W.P. No. 4196 of 2005. The learned Single Judge referred to the authority in A.K. Bindal (supra), adverted to the decision of the Bombay High Court in Pal v. Pal VRS Employees Welfare Association 2002-1 LLJ Bombay 527, that dealt with ""existing individual rights"" in the context of Section 33C(2) of the Act, distinguished the decision rendered in Government Soap Factory, Bangalore v. Labour Court AIR 1970 Mysore 225 and eventually held that the Labour Court had correctly exercised the jurisdiction by coming to hold that the writ Petitioners were no more workmen within the meaning of Section 2(s) of the Act and hence, there was no warrant for any interference in exercise of jurisdiction Under Article 226 of the Constitution. Dissatisfaction of non-success compelled the writ Petitioners to prefer Writ Appeal No. 820 of 2005 and the Division Bench concurred with the view expressed by the learned Single Judge in view of the dictum of this Court in A.K. Bindal (supra). Hence, the present appeal by special leave. We have already noted how the matter has been placed before the three-Judge Bench.

7. Section 2(s) of the Act defines the workman as follows:

""workman"" means any person (including an apprentice) employed in any industry to do any manual, unskilled, skilled, technical, operational, clerical or supervisory work for hire or reward, whether the terms of employment be express or implied, and for the purposes of any proceeding under this Act in relation to an industrial dispute, includes any such person who has been dismissed, discharged or retrenched in connection with, or as a consequence of, that dispute, or whose dismissal, discharge or retrenchment has led to that dispute, but does not include any such person -

(i) who is subject to the Air Force Act, 1950 (45 of 1950), or the Army Act, 1950 (46 of 1950), or the Navy Act, 1957 (62 of 1957); or

(ii) who is employed in the police service or as an officer or other employee of a prison; or

(iii) who is employed mainly in a managerial or administrative capacity; or

(iv) who, being employed in a supervisory capacity, draws wages exceeding [ten thousand rupees] per mensem or exercises, either by the nature of the duties attached to the office or by reason of the powers vested in him, functions mainly of a managerial nature.

8. Section 33C(2) of the Act reads as follows:

Where any workman is entitled to receive from the employer any money or any benefit which is capable of being computed in terms of money and if any question arises as to the amount of money due or as to the amount at which such benefit should be computed, then the question may, subject to any Rules that may be made under this Act, be decided by such Labour Court as may be specified in this behalf by the appropriate Government [within a period not exceeding three months]:

Provided that where the presiding officer of a Labour Court considers it necessary or expedient so to do, he may, for reasons to be recorded in writing, extend such period by such further period as he may think fit.

9. In A.K. Bindal (supra) a two-Judge Bench was considering the grant of pay revision in respect of companies which came under the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (for short, ""BIFR""). In the said case an issue also arose with regard to the framing of voluntary retirement scheme pertaining to the grievance of non-revision of the pay scale of the workmen. It was contended by the Respondents therein that the employees having taken VRS and having taken the amount without any demur, the relationship of employee and employer had ceased to exist and, therefore, they cannot raise any grievance regarding the non-revision of pay scale. The said submission was opposed on the ground that employees had no option in the matter and accepted VRS under compulsion and further under the VRS, the total compensation amounts have to be calculated as there was revision of pay scale since 1992 as claimed by the workmen and in that context opined thus:

34. This shows that a considerable amount is to be paid to an employee ex gratia besides the terminal benefits in case he opts for voluntary retirement under the Scheme and his option is accepted. The amount is paid not for doing any work or rendering any service. It is paid in lieu of the employee himself leaving the services of the company or the industrial establishment and foregoing all his claims or rights in the same. It is a package deal of give and take. That is why in the business world it is known as ""golden handshake"". The main purpose of paying this amount is to bring about a complete cessation of the jural relationship between the employer and the employee. After the amount is paid and the employee ceases to be under the employment of the company or the undertaking, he leaves with all his rights and there is no question of his again agitating for any kind of his past rights with his erstwhile employer including making any claim with regard to enhancement of pay scale for an earlier period. If the employee is still permitted to raise a grievance regarding enhancement of pay scale from a retrospective date, even after he has opted for Voluntary Retirement Scheme and has accepted the amount paid to him, the whole purpose of introducing the Scheme would be totally frustrated.

35. The contention that the employees opted for VRS under any kind of compulsion is not worthy of acceptance. The Petitioners are officers of the two Companies and are mature enough to weigh the pros and cons of the options which were available to them. They could have waited and pursued their claim for revision of pay scale without opting for VRS. However, they in their wisdom thought that in the fact situation VRS was a better option available and chose the same. After having applied for VRS and taken the money it is not open to them to contend that they exercised the option under any kind of compulsion. In view of the fact that nearly ninety-nine per cent of employees have availed of the VRS Scheme and have left the Companies (FCI and HFC), the writ petition no longer survives and has become infructuous.

10. In Pritam Singh Gill (supra), this Court was dealing with a case wherein the Respondent was dismissed from service w.e.f. September 19, 1967. He was suspended on October 5, 1964 and the order of suspension remained in force till September 18, 1967. During the period of suspension, on October 7, 1965, he was transferred to Delhi. After dismissal the Respondent applied to the Labour Court at Delhi Under Section 33C(2) of the Act for computing the benefits and amounts he was entitled to receive alleging that he had not been paid such amounts and benefits. The Labour Court framed certain issues and decided the claim in favour of the employee. The only question that arose before this Court pertained to jurisdiction of the Labour Court to entertain the employees' application Under Section 33C(2) of the Act. According to the Appellants, the Respondent-employee having already been dismissed had ceased to be the workman from the date of application and, therefore, he had no locus standi to approach the Labour Court Under Section 33C(2) of the Act. On behalf of the Respondent, it was argued that if the period in respect of which benefits and amounts are claimed Under Section 33C(2) of the Act was during the course of his employment prior to dismissal, then mere fact that he was dismissed by the employer before he could apply to the Labour Court Under Section 33C(2) would not deprive him of his right to claim relief under that Section. The Court posed the question whether Section 33C(2) of the Act can be invoked by dismissed workman in respect of benefits and salary due to him for the period prior to the date of his dismissal. The Court referred to the authorities in Central Bank of India v. P.S. Rajagopalan MANU/SC/0149/1963MANU/SC/0149/1963 : (1964) 3 SCR 140 and M/s. Kesoram Cotton Mills Ltd. v. Gangadhar and Ors. MANU/SC/0144/1963MANU/SC/0144/1963 : (1964) 2 SCR 809 and distinguished the said cases as the factual background was different. However, it reproduced certain passages from P.S. Rajagopalan (supra) because the Court in the said decision has discussed the legislative history of Chapter V-A and Section 33C of the Act and observed that:

In our opinion, on a fair and reasonable construction of Sub-section (2) it is clear that if a workman's right to receive the benefit is dispute, that may have to be determined by the Labour Court. Before proceeding to compute the benefit in terms of money the Labour Court inevitably has to deal with the question as to whether the workman has a right to receive that benefit. If the said right is not disputed, nothing more needs to be done and the Labour Court can proceed to compute the value of the benefit in terms of money; but if the said right is disputed, the Labour Court must deal with that question and decide whether the workman has the right to receive the benefit as alleged by him and it is only if the Labour Court answers this point in favour of title workman that the next question of making necessary computation can arise.

And again,

Besides, it seems to us that if the Appellant's construction is accepted, it would necessarily mean that it would be at the option of the employer to allow the workman to avail himself of the remedy provided by Sub-section (2) because he has merely to raise an objection on the ground that the right claimed by the workman is not admitted to oust the jurisdiction of the Labour Court to entertain the workman's application. The claim Under Section 33-C(2) clearly postulates that the determination of the question about computing the benefit in terms of money may, in some cases, have to be preceded by an enquiry into the existence of the right and such an enquiry must be held to be incidental to the main determination which has been assigned to the Labour Court by Sub-section (2).

11. After reproducing the said passages, the Court referred to the authority in U.P. Electric Supply Co. Ltd. v. R.K. Shukla and Anr. MANU/SC/0333/1969MANU/SC/0333/1969 : AIR 1970 SC 237 : 1969 (2) SCC 400 wherein the Court after review of various decisions had upheld the jurisdiction of the Labour Court to entertain application for lay off-compensation Under Section 33C(2) observing that such jurisdiction could not be ousted by a mere plea denying the workman's claim for computation of the benefit in terms of money, adding that the Labour Court had to go into the question and determine whether on the facts it had jurisdiction to make the computation.

12. Thereafter, the Court in Pritam Singh Gill (supra) referred to number of decisions and posed the question thus:

The crucial point which requires consideration on the Appellant's argument is thus confined to the precise scope and meaning of the word ""workman"" used in Section 33-C(2) in the background of the definition of this word as contained in Section 2(s).

13. Thereafter, it was held:

This Section was enacted for the purpose of enabling individual workman to implement, enforce or execute their existing individual rights against their employers without being compelled to have recourse to Section 10 by raising disputes and securing a reference which is obviously a lengthy process. Section 33-C of the Act has accordingly been described as a provision which clothes the Labour Court with the powers similar to those of an executing court so that the workman concerned receives speedy relief in respect of his existing individual rights. The primary purpose of the Section being to provide the aggrieved workman with a forum similar to the executing courts, it calls for a broad and beneficial construction consistently with other provisions of the Act, which should serve to advance the remedy and to suppress the mischief. It may appropriately be pointed out that the mischief which Section 33-C was designed to suppress was the difficulties faced by individual workmen in getting relief in respect of their existing rights without having resort to Section 10 of the Act. To accept the argument of the Appellant, it would always be open to an unfair, unsympathetic and unscrupulous employer to terminate the services of his employee in order to deprive him of the benefit conferred by Section 33-C and compel him to have resort to the lengthy procedure by way of reference Under Section 10 of the Act thereby defeating the very purpose and object of enacting this provision. This, in our view, quite clearly brings out the repugnancy visualised in the opening part of Section 2 of the Act and such a position could hardly have been contemplated by the Legislature. In order to remove this repugnancy Section 33-C(2) must be so construed as to take within its fold a workman, who was employed during the period in respect of which he claims relief, even though he is no longer employed at the time of the application. In other words the term ""workman"" as used in Section 33-C(2) includes all persons whose claim, requiring computation under this Sub-section, is in respect of an existing right arising from his relationship as an industrial workman with his employer. By adopting this construction alone can we advance the remedy and suppress the mischief in accordance with the purpose and object of inserting Section 33-C in the Act. We are, therefore, inclined to agree with the view taken by the Madras decisions and we approve of their approach. According to Shri Malhotra, in cases where there is no dispute about the employee's right which is not denied, he will be entitled to file a suit. Whether or not the right of suit can be claimed by the employee, we are not persuaded on the basis of this argument to accept the construction canvassed on behalf of the Appellant and deny to a dismissed employee the benefit of speedy remedy Under Section 33-C(2) of the Act.

[Emphasis supplied]

14. It needs to be noted that after so stating, the three-Judge Bench clarified that its pronouncement was strictly in the context of the Act. The Court opined that in the case at hand they were only concerned with the Act and it should not be treated as expression of an opinion as regards the provisions of the Minimum Wages Act.

15. Be it stated immediately, in the case at hand to appreciate the applicability of the provisions contained in Section 33C(2) of the Act, it is necessary to appreciate the benefits available to the employees under the VRS. The benefits which are available are reproduced below:

BENEFITS:

The following benefits are payable to the employees covered under the scheme.

Terminal benefits:

The following benefits as statutorily due will be paid as per eligibility.

i. The balance in the P.F. Account payable as per the CPF Regulation.

ii. Cash equivalent of accumulated earned leave as per the Rules of the enterprise.

iii. Gratuity as per the provisions of the Payment of Gratuity Act or other applicable Rules of the Organisation.

Ex-gratia Benefits:

i) An employee who is regular or permanent, whose request for VRS is accepted would be entitled to an Ex-gratia payment equivalent to One and Half months emoluments (Pay + DA) last drawn, for each completed year of service or the monthly emoluments at the time of retirement multiplied by the balance months of service left before normal date of retirement whichever is less, subject to a minimum of Rs. 30,000/- (Rupees Thirty Thousand only).

One month/three months notice pay, as per the service conditions applicable.

If the application of an employee opting for VRS is accepted instantaneously and payment is arranged by the management on the same day, the concerned individual would be entitled for payment of ex-gratia along with pay for notice-period.

Payment of ex-gratia for services rendered or left over service(whichever is less), as well as the amount payable for the Notice period should, however, not exceed the basic pay + DA that would have been paid to the employee who has opted for VRS till the date of his superannuation.

Where the management takes times to take a decision on the acceptance of an application submitted by the employees for VRS and allows the notice period to lapse or the employee concerned has drawn full salary during the notice period served by him, the pay for notice period would not be admissible as the employee has already drawn the salary for the notice period.

In addition the Employee and his family would also be entitled to travel fare of the admissible class to his native place within the State of Andhra Pradesh, which will be verified with reference to his L.T.C. file.

ii) For calculation of ex-gratia under the Scheme the fraction of service viz., 6 months and above will be treated as one year and service of less than 6 months will be ignored.

iii) EOL upto a period of one year will be considered for calculation of ex-gratia benefits, provided the Service Regulations of the concerned Organizations permit sanction of such EOL.

16. We need not refer to the other clauses as they do not really provide for any kind of benefit but stipulate the various aspects for implementation of the VRS and the procedure to be adopted. On a perusal of the VRS, it is clear as day that it did not deal with the lay-off compensation. As has been laid down in Pritam Singh Gill (supra), a claim pertaining to non-payment of suspension allowance could be agitated under the said provision in spite of the employee being dismissed from service. In A.K. Bindal (supra) the two-Judge Bench has held that after acceptance of the scheme and availing of benefits under VRS an employee could not claim higher wages. The controversy was different. If the VRS had mentioned about the lay-off compensation, needless to say, the claim would have been covered and the amount received by the workmen would have been deemed to have been covered the quantum of lay-off compensation. That is not the factual position. Therefore, the controversy that arose in Pritam Singh Gill (supra) and the dispute that emanated in A.K. Bindal (supra) are quite different. Hence, we are disposed to think that there exists no conflict between Pritam Singh Gill (supra) and A.K. Bindal (supra). We think it appropriate to say that though there is cessation of relationship between the employee and the employer in VRS but if it does not cover the past dues like lay-off compensation, subsistence allowance, etc., the workman would be entitled to approach the Labour Court Under Section 33C(2) of the Act. If it is specifically covered, or the language of VRS would show that it covers the claim under the scheme, no forum will have any jurisdiction.

17. With the aforesaid clarification, we would have directed to list the matter before the two-Judge Bench. It is not so required. It is noticeable that the claim relating to lay-off compensation is not covered in the VRS. The Labour Court, learned single Judge and the Division Bench have declined to entertain the claim on the ground that they had no jurisdiction to adjudicate the controversy. We have already held that claim pertaining to lay-off compensation having not been part of the VRS, the Labour Court has jurisdiction to adjudicate Under Section 33C(2) of the Act. Therefore, we set aside the judgment and order of the High Court and that of the Labour Court.

18. Resultantly, the appeal is allowed, the impugned judgments and orders are set aside and the matter is remitted to the Labour Court for adjudication in accordance with law. The Labour Court shall finalise the claim preferred Under Section 33C(2) of the Act on its own merits within three months hence. The parties are directed to appear before the Labour Court on 17th October, 2016. There shall be no order as to costs.

M. Yusuf Eqbal, J.

1. Leave granted.

2. This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and order dated 04.04.2014 of the Gauhati High Court whereby the revision petition filed by the Respondents was allowed and the eviction suit filed by the Appellant was dismissed.

3. The litigation between the parties commenced when the Appellant filed an eviction suit against Abdul Karim, the father of the Respondents. The case of the Appellant was that he had became the owner of the suit property by virtue of two exchange deeds executed on 23.04.1975 with his brother PW 3 Ranjeet Prasad, the original owner. In 1968, before the execution of the said exchange deed, PW 3 Ranjeet Prasad was said to have let one of the rooms in the building in the suit property to Rahim Baksh, the father of Abdul Karim and the grandfather of the Respondents. However, even after the execution of the exchange deed, PW 3 Ranjeet Prasad was stated to have continued collecting rent from the tenants of the suit property including Rahim Baksh and on Rahim's death, his son Abdul Karim till February, 2007 with the consent of the Appellant. In 2007, the Appellant was stated to have taken over the affairs of the suit property, mutated his name as the owner and requested Abdul Karim to execute a fresh agreement with him. The Appellant contended that Abdul Karim had not only failed to execute a fresh agreement but also failed to pay the rent except for the electricity bills. The Appellant also cited bonafide need of the suit property for the purpose of opening a medical clinic being a retired surgeon. The Appellant hence prayed for the eviction of Abdul Karim.

4. Defendant Abdul Karim filed written statement denying all the allegations and alleged that PW 3 Ranjeet Prasad had executed tenancy agreement dated 28.12.1968 in favour of Rahim Baksh and later on executed tenancy agreement dated 20.05.2006 in his favour. He denied being informed of the exchange deed dated 23.04.1975 and contended that Ranjeet Prasad was his landlord and not the Appellant. The Defendant Abdul Karim alleged that since they refused to accept the rent from him from March, 2007 onwards, the Defendant deposited the rent in court. The Defendant prayed for the dismissal of the suit.

5. The trial court noted that PW 3 Ranjeet Prasad had represented himself to be the landlord in the agreement dated 20.05.2006 and in the rent receipts and also filed a suit for eviction against one of the tenants in the suit property in the capacity of a landlord. PW 3 was noted to have never stated being the representative of the Appellant or there being a property exchange. Even if it was assumed that he had received the electricity charges, the Appellant was held to have failed to prove himself as the landlord as the Appellant had not produced any evidence of having received rent from any of tenants. The mutation entry in his name was held to be not proof of title in the suit property. Considering the deposition of Abdul Karim as DW 1, wherein he stated that the Appellant had refused to accept the rent from him, the trial court held that the Appellant had waived his right to be called a landlord. The trial court held that PW 3 Ranjeet Prasad was the landlord of the suit property Under Section 2(c) of the Assam Urban Areas Rent Control Act, 1972 (in short, ""Rent Act""). The trial court dismissed the suit, rejecting Plaintiff- Appellant's contention that Abdul Karim had defaulted in the payment of rent and that he needed the suit property for bonafide use on the grounds that the Appellant was not the landlord of the suit property and Abdul Karim had been admittedly depositing the rent in the court.

6. Aggrieved by the decision of the trial court, the Appellant preferred an appeal before the District Court. The appellate court noted that the ownership of the suit property has been proved in the light of the exchange deed, which remained unchallenged by the Defendant and supported by PW 3 Ranjeet Prasad. The appellate court further noted that the Plaintiff served notice requesting Abdul Karim to attorn the Appellant as the landlord and pay the rent to him. The appellate court, therefore, held that the Appellant is the landlord of the suit property considering the deposition of Abdul Karim that the Appellant had refused to accept the rent from him, the deposition of PW 3 Ranjeet Prasad that he had directed all the tenants to pay the rent to the Appellant from March, 2007 onwards and the admission of the Respondent No. 1 (DW 2) son of Abdul Karim, that he was paying the electricity charges to the Appellant. Abdul Karim was held to have defaulted in the payment of rent from March, 2007 onwards as he was depositing rent in the court in the name of PW 3 Ranjeet Prasad and not the Appellant despite knowing that the Appellant was the landlord. The Appellant also proved the need for bonafide use as he and his wife were medical practitioners wanting to open a clinic in the rented premises and as the Defendant Abdul Karim owns another premises and would not hence be facing difficulty. Allowing the appeal, the appellate court directed the Defendant Abdul Karim to vacate the suit property.

7. Aggrieved Respondents, therefore, preferred a revision petition before the High Court. The High Court observed that the appellate court has not considered the tenancy agreements dated 20.12.1968 and 20.05.2006, which were also not mentioned in the depositions of the Appellant (PW 1) and Ranjeet Prasad (PW 3) and the plaint. The High Court upheld the trial court findings regarding the various instances when PW 3 represented himself as the landlord. Observing that there was no conveyance of title after the execution of the agreement dated 20.05.2006, the High Court opined that the Appellant could not be held to be the owner or landlord of the suit property on the basis of the exchange deed dated 23.04.1975. The High Court observed that the definitions of the terms 'tenant' and 'landlord' were not related to ownership of the suit property. PW 3 Ranjeet Prasad was held to be the landlord of Defendant Abdul Karim considering the agreements dated 20.12.1968 and 20.05.2006 and that Ranjeet Prasad had filed eviction suits as a landlord. Once landlord-tenant relationship existed between the PW 3 Ranjeet Prasad and the Defendant Abdul Karim, the same should have been determined only as per the provisions of the Rent Control Act. Holding that there was no need to give a finding regarding default in the payment of rent or bonafide requirement when there was no landlord-tenant relationship between the Appellant and the Defendant Abdul Karim, the High Court allowed the revision petition filed by the Respondents-tenants and dismissed the suit for eviction filed by the Appellant.

8. Hence, the present appeal by special leave by the Plaintiff.

9. While reversing the appellate court judgment, the High Court in paragraph Nos. 11 and 13 of the impugned order held as under:

11. This revision petition arises out of a claim of relief Under Section 5 of the Assam Urban Areas Rent Control Act, 1972. Unlike general law governing tenancy, this Act confers a statutory status on tenant and on attainment of such status a tenant earns protection guaranteed Under Section 5 of this Act. No tenant under this Act can be evicted without a decree of Court. The landlord, therefore, is duty bound to obtain a decree from court by establishing the conditions precedent laid down Under Section 5 referred to above. The foundation of such a suit is relationship of landlord and tenant. The fact that there exists a relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties is the starting point for conferring jurisdiction on a court to entertain and decide the dispute. Such fact constituting landlord tenant relationship, therefore, is a jurisdictional fact and not a mere fact and as such High Court, in exercise of revisional jurisdiction Under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, is duty bound to examine as to whether such a finding arrived at by the learned Court or Courts below is tenable and/or based on materials on record.

13. These aspects are no doubt relevant for the purpose of adjudicating a jurisdictional fact as to landlord tenant relationship in a proceeding Under Section 5 of the Assam Urban Areas Rent Control Act, 1972. Apparently, these relevant aspects were not considered by the learned appellate court. The finding of the learned appellate court, therefore, on issue No. 4 is vitiated by non-consideration of relevant aspect and non-consideration of exhibits Ka, Kha and Gha. The finding of the first appellate court that there is a landlord and tenant relationship between the Plaintiff and the Defendant is liable to be held as perverse, inasmuch as, Plaintiff has failed to meet the challenges thrown by the Defendant by bringing on record exhibits Ka, Kha and Gha and claiming that Plaintiff never derived the title from Ranjeet Prasad subsequent to creation of tenancy in 2006. The decision of appellate court, on issue No. 4, therefore, is liable to be interfered with. Once it is held that there is no landlord and tenant relationship between the Plaintiff and the Defendant, there is no question of giving any decision on the issue of default or bona-fide requirement. Consequently, findings of the first appellate court on these 2 (two) issues are also set aside. In the result, civil revision petition is allowed and the impugned appellate judgment is set aside restoring the judgment of the learned Trial court.

10. We have heard learned Counsel appearing for the parties. Before coming to the conclusion, we would like to refer to the relevant provisions of the Assam Urban Area Rent Control Act, 1972.

11. The expression ""landlord"" has been defined in Section 2(c) of the Rent Act which reads as under:

(c) Landlord"" means any person who is, for the time being receiving, or entitled to receive rent in respect of any house whether on his own account, or on account, or on behalf, or for the benefit of any other person, or as a trustee, guardian, or receiver for any other person; and includes, in respect of his subtenant, a tenant who has sub-let any house and includes every person not being a tenant who from time to time derives title under a landlord.

12. Section 5 of the Act creates a bar against the passing or execution of a decree or order for ejection. Section 5 reads as under:

5. (1) No order or decree for the recovery of possession of any house shall be made or executed by any Court so long as the tenant pays rent to the full extent allowable under this Act and performs the conditions of the tenancy:

Provided that nothing in this Sub-section shall apply in a suit or proceedings for eviction of the tenant from the house:-

(a) Where the tenant has done anything contrary to the provisions of Clause (m), Clause (o) or Clause (p) of Section 108 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 or to the spirit of the aforesaid clause in areas where the said Act does not apply, or

(b) Where the tenant has been guilty of conduct which is a nuisance of an annoyance to the occupiers of the adjoining or neighbouring houses, or

(c) Where the house is bonafide required by the landlord either for purposes of repairs or rebuilding, or for his own occupation or for the occupation of any person for whose benefit the house is held, or whether the landlord can show any other cause which may be deemed satisfactory by the Court, or

(d) Where the tenant sublets the house or any part thereof or otherwise transfers his interest in the house or any part thereof without permission in writing from the landlord, or

(e) Where the tenant has not paid the rent lawfully due from him in respect of the house within a fortnight of its falling due, or

(f) Where the tenant has built, acquired or been allotted a suitable residence.

13. From the definition of 'landlord', it is clear that the definition is couched in a very wide language, according to which not only the owner but also any person receiving rent, whether on his own account or on behalf of or for the benefit of any other person or as a trustee, guardian, or receiver for any other person, is also the landlord.

14. However, for the purpose of eviction of a tenant on the ground of personal need or reasonable requirement, one must show that he is the owner of the building.

15. A similar question came for consideration before a three Judges Bench of this Court in the case of M.M. Quasim v. Manohar Lal Sharma and Ors. MANU/SC/0223/1980MANU/SC/0223/1980 : AIR 1981 SC 113. The matter related to the Bihar Building (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1947. In the Bihar Rent Act, the definition of expression 'landlord' is similar as that of Assam Rent Act. Further the ground for eviction of personal necessity is also similar to that of the Assam Act. Considering these provisions, this Court held:

14...Therefore, while taking advantage of the enabling provision, enacted in Section 11(1)(c), the person claiming possession on the ground of his reasonable requirement of the leased building must show that he is a landlord in the sense that he is owner of the building and has a right to occupy the same in his own right. A mere rent collector, though may be included in the expression ""landlord"" in its wide amplitude, cannot be treated as a landlord for the purposes of Section 11(1)(c). This becomes manifestly clear from the explanation appended to the clause. By restricting the meaning of expression ""landlord"" for the purpose of Section 11(1)(c), the legislature manifested its intention namely that landlord alone can seek eviction on the ground of his personal requirement if he is one who has a right against the whole world to occupy the building himself and exclude any one holding a title lesser than his own. Such landlord who is an owner and who would have a right to occupy the building in his own right, can seek possession for his own use. The latter part of the section envisages a situation where the landlord is holding the building for the benefit of some other person but in that case landlord can seek to evict tenant not for his personal use but for the personal requirement of that person for whose benefit he holds the building. The second clause contemplates a situation of trustees and cesti que trust but when the case is governed by the first part of Clause (c) of Sub-section (1) of Section 11, the person claiming possession for personal requirement must be such a landlord who wants possession for his own occupation and this would imply that he must be a person who has a right to remain in occupation against the whole world and not someone who has no subsisting interest in the property and is merely a rent collector such as an agent, executor, administrator or a receiver of the property. For the purposes of Section 11(1)(c) the expression 'landlord' could, therefore, mean a person who is the owner of the building and who has a right to remain in occupation and actual possession of the building to the exclusion of everyone else. It is such a person who can seek to evict the tenant on the ground that he requires possession in good faith for his own occupation. A rent collector or an agent is not entitled to occupy the house in his own right. Even if such a person be a lessor and, therefore, a landlord within the expanded inclusive definition of the expression landlord, nonetheless he cannot seek to evict the tenant on the ground that he wants to personally occupy the house. He cannot claim such a right against the real owner and as a necessary corollary he cannot seek to evict the tenant on the ground that he wants possession of the premises for his own occupation. That can be the only reasonable interpretation one can put on the ingredients of Clause (c) of Section 11(1) which reads: ""Where the building is reasonably and in good faith required by the landlord for his own occupation..."" Assuming that the expression ""landlord"" has to be understood with the same connotation as is spelt out by the definition clause, even a rent collector or a receiver of the property appointed by the court in bankruptcy proceedings would be able to evict the tenant alleging that he wants the building for his own occupation, a right which he could not have claimed against the real owner. Therefore, the explanation to Clause (c) which cuts down the wide amplitude of the expression ""landlord"" would unmistakably show that for the purposes of Clause (c) such landlord who in the sense in which the word 'owner' is understood can claim as of right to the exclusion of everyone, to occupy the house, would be entitled to evict the tenant for his own occupation.

16. The High Court appears to have taken a very narrow meaning and interpretation of the expression 'landlord' as defined in the Assam Rent Act. The finding recorded on that score to the effect that there exists no relationship of landlord and tenant is not in accordance with the true meaning of the term 'landlord'. This aspect of the law has not been considered by the High Court. On the contrary, the High Court proceeded on the basis that the relationship of 'landlord and tenant' has not been established although the ownership of the Appellant by virtue of the deed of exchange has neither been denied nor been disputed by the Respondent -tenant. Even assuming for the sake of argument that the elder brother of the Appellant was acting as a landlord by receiving rent, it will not debar the original owner from filing a suit for eviction not only on the ground of personal necessity but also on the ground of default when it has come in evidence that the Respondent on many occasions went to the Appellant to pay rent but the latter refused to receive the rent. Moreover, admittedly, the Respondent -tenant was paying electricity and other charges of the tenanted premises to the Appellant.

17. On the question of tenancy, both the trial court and the High Court have not considered the provision of Section 109 of the Transfer of Property Act.

109. Rights of lessor's transferee.--If the lessor transfers the property leased, or any part thereof, or any part of his interest therein, the transferee, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, shall possess all the rights, and, if the lessee so elects, be subject to all the liabilities of the lessor as to the property or part transferred so long as he is the owner of it; but the lessor shall not, by reason only of such transfer cease to be subject to any of the liabilities imposed upon him by the lease, unless the lessee elects to treat the transferee as the person liable to him:

Provided that the transferee is not entitled to arrears of rent due before the transfer, and that, if the lessee, not having reason to believe that such transfer has been made, pays rent to the lessor, the lessee shall not be liable to pay such rent over again to the transferee.

The lessor, the transferee and the lessee may determine what proportion of the premium or rent reserved by the lease is payable in respect of the part so transferred, and, in case they disagree, such determination may be made by any Court having jurisdiction to entertain a suit for the possession of the property leased.

18. From perusal of the aforesaid Section, it is manifest that after the transfer of lessor's right in favour of the transferee, the latter gets all rights and liabilities of the lessor in respect of subsisting tenancy. The Section does not insist that transfer will take effect only when the tenant attorns. It is well settled that a transferee of the landlord's rights steps into the shoes of the landlord with all the rights and liabilities of the transferor landlord in respect of the subsisting tenancy. The section does not require that the transfer of the right of the landlord can take effect only if the tenant attorns to him. Attornment by the tenant is not necessary to confer validity of the transfer of the landlord's rights. Since attornment by the tenant is not required, a notice Under Section 106 in terms of the old terms of lease by the transferor landlord would be proper and so also the suit for ejectment.

19. As noticed above, the Respondent -tenant on many occasions approached the Appellant, the transferee, owner and the landlord to receive the rent. Further, admittedly, the electricity charges of the tenanted premises were paid by the tenant to the present Appellant. Non-consideration of subsequent tenancy agreement executed by the erstwhile owner namely the brother of the Appellant will not come in the way of the present Appellant to seek eviction of the tenant on the ground of personal necessity as also on the ground of non-payment of rent. The approach of the High Court reversing the appellate court's finding cannot be sustained in law.

20. For the aforesaid reasons, this appeal is allowed and the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court is set aside. However, there shall be no order as to costs.

Ranjan Gogoi, J.

1. These three appeals seek to challenge the common order of the High Court of Judicature at Madras dated 29th January, 2007 passed in Second Appeal Nos. 543 to 545 of 1994 by which the decree of the dismissal of the suits filed by the Plaintiff has been reversed by the High Court.

2. We have heard the learned Counsels for the parties.

3. The common case of the Plaintiff as pleaded in the suits filed is that the Plaintiff is the owner of the suit properties by virtue of Patta No. 1 granted to it and that the Defendants are either lessees under the Plaintiff or sub-lessees/sub-assignees under the lessees of the Plaintiff. According to the Plaintiff, the Defendants had stopped rendering service to the temple and had also not paid the rent due. Instead they had set up title to the suit properties. The leases were accordingly terminated by issuing notices Under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act. Thereafter, the suits for declaration of title and recovery of possession were instituted.

4. The Defendants in each of the suit contested the case of the Plaintiff and filed their written statements. According to the Defendants, the suit properties belonged to them by inheritance; the Plaintiff is not the owner thereof. In any case, according to the Defendants, they had acquired title to the suit properties by prescription on account of their long possession. The Defendants had filed additional written statements in each of the case contending that they were permanent ryots under the Tamil Nadu Estates Land Act, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as ""the 1908 Act"") and that the suit properties are included in an estate which was abolished under the Tamil Nadu Estates (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1948 (hereinafter referred to as ""the 1948 Act""). Hence, according to the Defendants, the Plaintiff had no locus to institute the suits in question.

5. The learned trial Court, as also the first appellate Court, took the view that Patta No. 1 on the basis of which the Plaintiff had claimed title had not been exhibited. Thereafter, the learned trial Court and the first appellate Court went into the case pleaded by the Defendants and held that the rent receipts issued by the Plaintiff to the Defendants (Exhibits B4, B5 to B8, B12 to B22 and B27 to B37) establish that the suit properties were an estate under the 1908 Act and further that by virtue of the 1948 Act the said estate stood abolished. On this additional ground also the learned trial Court as well as the first appellate Court decided against the Plaintiff.

6. The High Court in Second Appeal framed the following substantial questions of law for adjudication.

7. In answering the aforesaid questions the High Court admittedly did not deal with the rights of the Plaintiff under the Patta as claimed i.e. Patta No. 1. Instead, the High Court relying on the rent receipts issued by the Plaintiff wherein the Plaintiff had described itself as EKABOGAM Mirasidar proceeded to determine the status of Mirasidars and the special incidents of mirasi tenures relying on its own decision rendered in Ramalinga Mudali and Anr. v. T.S. Ramasami Ayyar [MANU/TN/0376/1928MANU/TN/0376/1928 : AIR 1929 Madras 529] and C.N. Varadappan v. The State of Madras represented by the Collector of Chingleput at Saidapet, Madras and Ors. [MANU/TN/0448/1959MANU/TN/0448/1959 : 1963(1) MLJ 405]. On such consideration, the High Court came to the conclusion that the title and ownership of the suit properties vested in the Plaintiff as a Mirasidar. The claim of the Defendants to being permanent ryots under the 1908 Act on the basis of the rent receipts issued Under Section 63 of the said Act was negatived by the High Court on the ground that the said receipts were printed receipts also covering another village which was a Inam village. Insofar as the 1948 Act (Abolition Act) is concerned, the High Court took the view that the notification required to be published Under Section 1(4) of the 1948 Act was not brought on record by the Defendants; neither the follow up steps as required Under Sections 11 and 16 had been proved by the Defendants. Accordingly it was held that the Defendants had failed to prove that the 1948 Act had any application. Similarly, on finding that the evidence on record failed to establish the continuous possession of the Defendants, the claim of acquisition of title by prescription as set up by the Defendants was dismissed.

8. Shri Jaideep Gupta, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Appellants in Civil Appeal No. 738 of 2008, has strenuously urged that Patta No. 1 on the basis of which the Plaintiff had claimed title not having been proved the High Court ought not to have proceeded to consider the Defendants' case at all. In any view of the matter, even the adjudication of the Defendants' plea is vitiated by apparent illegalities inasmuch as the rent receipts issued by the Plaintiff to the Defendants were Under Section 63 of the 1908 Act. The said fact by itself, according to the learned Counsel, had proved that the suit properties were included in an estate under the 1908 Act. Shri Gupta has further urged that even if the Defendants can be understood not to have proved the abolition of the estate under the 1948 Act, the Defendants had acquired the status of occupancy ryots under the 1908 Act which vested in them a permanent right of occupancy besides heritable and transferable rights to the land. The above arguments have been adopted by the learned Counsel for the Appellants in the two other appeals under consideration.

9. Opposing, Shri K. Ramamoorthy, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Respondent-Plaintiff, has urged that the Patta No. 1 being a century old document could not have been legitimately placed before the Court as an exhibit in the case. Shri Ramamoorthy, in this regard, has drawn the attention of the Court to Exhibit A-21, the Thiruporur Village Resettlement Register, which, according to him, would establish the existence of Patta No. 1 in favour of the Respondent-Plaintiff. Shri Ramamoorthy by relying on the decision in Ramalinga Mudali and Anr. v. T.S. Ramasami Ayyar [MANU/TN/0376/1928MANU/TN/0376/1928 : AIR 1929 Madras 1929] has urged that under the land tenures legitimized during the British regime the Plaintiff acquired the status of Mirasidar which vested ownership rights in the suit land in favour of the Plaintiff. Insofar as the applicability of the 1908 Act is concerned, Shri Ramamoorthy has drawn the attention of the Court to the findings recorded in this regard by the High Court. It is contended that the rent receipts were issued in a printed format both for Thiruporur Village as well as for Thandalam village and the latter village was Inam estate. No positive conclusion, therefore, can be drawn with regard to the status of the Defendants under the 1908 Act. In any case, according to Shri Ramamoorthy, the Defendants had failed to establish that the estate, even if assumed to exist, was abolished under the 1948 Act.

10. The Plaintiff's case was based on Patta No. 1. Admittedly, the said Patta was not exhibited. According to the Respondent-Plaintiff, Exhibit A-21 establishes the grant of the aforesaid Patta No. 1 in favour of the Plaintiff. We have perused the said exhibit which is a Land Resettlement Register. Undoubtedly, the said exhibit, inter alia, shows that Patta No. 1 is in favour of Singaravelu Mudali Manager for the time being of Sri Kandaswamiyar Devasthanam. Beyond the above, Exhibit A-21 does not throw any further light on the nature and extent of the rights conferred on the Plaintiff by Patta No. 1. There is also no oral evidence on record to explain the nature of the rights granted under Patta No. 1. In such a situation, the materials on record do not permit any conclusive determination of the title of the Plaintiff on the basis of Patta No. 1. As the existence of Patta No. 1 had been proved but the nature of the rights under the Patta was not clear, one cannot find any fault with the exercise undertaken by the High court to determine the claims of the parties on the basis of preponderance of probabilities and in this regard by seeking to examine the status of the Plaintiff as Mirasidar. However, the High Court appears to have acted a little hastily in accepting the status of the Plaintiff as Mirsadars solely on the basis of the description contained in the rent receipts and further in accepting the position that as Mirsadars the Plaintiff had been vested with title to the suit land. In C.N. Varadappan v. The State of Madras represented by the Collector of Chingleput at Saidapet, Madras and Ors. [MANU/TN/0448/1959MANU/TN/0448/1959 : 1963(1) MLJ 405] it was held and in our opinion correctly that a mere recital in a document that a person was a ekabogam mirasdar or the mere fact that he was the sole owner of kaniachi manyam at a given time would not necessarily show that he was the owner of the entire kudiwaram in the village at the time of a shrotriem grant to him. The meaning of all such expressions have been clearly elaborated in the judgment of the High Court and would not need a recital again. Furthermore, a reading of the judgment in Ramalinga Mudali and Anr. v. T.S. Ramasami Ayyar (supra) would go to show that the status of Mirasdar differs from village to village and the exact status of a Mirasdar is best determined on the basis of the evidence that may come on record. In the present case, the High Court proceeded to recognize the status of the Plaintiff as a Mirasdar and the right/title of the Plaintiff to the suit land on that basis without there being any evidence of such status (Mirasdar) of the Plaintiff the nature and extent of the right held and enjoyed by the Plaintiff, even if its status as Mirasdar is assumed.

11. Insofar as the question raised by the Defendants with regard to the suit land being included in an estate under the 1908 Act is concerned, we find that the High Court had not given any specific finding in this regard but has proceeded to answer the question from an entirely different standpoint, 'namely, that the rent receipts issued were printed both for Thiruporur Village and Thandalam village and that Thandalam village was Inam estate which was taken over under the 1948 Act. On the above basis, the High Court had concluded that the abolition of the estate under the 1948 Act was not proved by the Defendants.

12. Even if the abolition of the estate under the 1948 Act had not been proved by the Defendants, if the suit land is included in an estate under the 1908 Act and the Defendants were tenants under the Plaintiff the same would confer certain specific rights on the Defendants Under Section 6 of the 1908 Act. Such rights which would flow from their status as occupancy tenants would entitle the Defendants to remain in possession with heritable and transferable right in respect of the land. The issue before the High Court therefore needed to be resolved on more surer foundation that what has been done.

13. The foregoing discussions lead us to the conclusion that the findings with regard to the title of the Plaintiff on the basis of Patta No. 1 (Exhibit A-21); whether the Plaintiff was Mirasdar and, if so, the extent of their rights and further whether the suit properties were included in an estate under the 1908 conferring the Defendants the status of occupancy ryots; all would require a fresh determination. In the above situation it will not be proper and appropriate to maintain the findings of the High Court as recorded in the impugned order. We, therefore, set aside the order of the High Court and remand the matter for fresh decision on the issues indicated above. The High Court, if it so requires, may permit the parties to adduce additional evidence for the purpose of full and complete adjudication of the issues indicated in the present order. Consequently and in the light of the discussion that has preceded, we allow these appeals to the extent indicated above.

S.B. Sinha, J.

1. Whether the State of Andhra Pradesh had the legislative competence to enact Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education Act, 1988 (Act 16 of 1988) (hereinafter called as ""the 1988 Act"") is the core question involved in these appeals which arise out of a judgment and order passed by the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Writ Petition No. 17222 of 1988.

2. The fact leading to filing of the Writ Petition by the respondent herein questioning the vires of the 1988 Act arose in the following circumstances:

3. The Central Government evolved a National Education Policy in the year 1986 pursuant whereto and in furtherance whereof, recommendations were made for creating a State Level Planning for coordination of the High Education through Councils of Higher Education. Such councils were proposed to be set up as statutory bodies having regard to the fact that there did not exist any effective machinery for planning and coordination of higher education at the State level vis-a-vis implementation of me programmers made by the University Grants Commission (UGC). With a view of give effect to the said policy. UGC constituted a committee to go into the said matter and make recommendations regarding setting up of the said Councils of higher education and programme of action to be taken in that behalf. The pressing need for constituting effective machinery for promotion and coordination of higher education at the State level and coordination of State level programmes with those of the UGC was felt and pursuant thereto and in furtherance thereof. UGC formulated guidelines for setting up of such Councils as recommended by the Committee.

4. In the year 1986 the State of Andhra Pradesh passed an Act known as the Andhra Pradesh Commissionerate of Higher Education Act, 1986 (hereinafter called as 'the Commissionerate Act'). The Commissionerate Act was enacted purported to be pursuant to or in furtherance of the recommendations of the Vice-Chancellors' Committee on higher education in the State of Andhra Pradesh. The constitutionality of the said Act inter alia was questioned on the ground of lack of legislative competence having regard to the parliamentary Act known as University Grants Commission Act enacted in terms of Entry 66, List I of the VII Schedule of the Constitution of India. The said writ petitions were filed by the respondent herein and four others as also the Osmania University Teachers Association. The said writ petitions were dismissed by a Full Bench of Andhra Pradesh High Court by a judgment dated 24.03.1987. However, on an appeal there against this Court in Osmania University Teachers Association v. State of Andhra Pradesh and Anr. MANU/SC/0126/1987MANU/SC/0126/1987 : [1987]3SCR949 held that the State Legislature had no legislative competence thereof.

5. As a necessary fallout of the said decision, guidelines were sought to be reviewed where for request was made by the Government of India to the Commission.

6. In the light of the judgment, the Department of Education. Government of India requested the Commission to review the guidelines. Accordingly, the guidelines were reviewed with the help of the law panel of the Commission. The relevant extracts of the revised guidelines as approved by the Commission in January, 1988 are as under:

""2.0 Setting up of the Council

In order to achieve the objectives set out above, the Central Government may advise State Governments for enacting legislation for setting up of State Councils of Higher Education in the States. In an Indian state where the number of universities are too few, an advisory body may be set up to fulfil the above objectives.

8.0 Powers and Functions of the Council

The Council shall function for coordination and determination of standards in institutions for higher education or research and scientific and technical institution in accordance with the guidelines issued by the UGC from time to time.

8.1 Planning and Coordination

(i) To prepare consolidated programmes in the sphere of higher education in the State in accordance with the guidelines that may be issued by the UGC from time to time, and to assist in their implementation.

(ii) To forward the development programmes of universities and colleges in the State to UGC along with its comments and recommendations.

(iii) To assist UGC in respect of determination and maintenance of standards and suggest remedial action wherever necessary, in accordance with the guidelines.

(iv) To evolve perspective plans for development of higher education in the State.

(v) To monitor the progress of implementation of such development programmes.

11.0 Annual Report

The Council shall prepare an Annual Report giving an account of its activities during the previous year and copies thereof shall be forwarded to the State Government and the Government shall cause the same to be laid before the Legislative Assembly. A copy of the Annual Report should be sent to Universities Grants Commission.""

7. Pursuant to or in furtherance of the said recommendations revised guidelines as approved by the Commission were issued in January, 1988 and relying on or acting on the basis thereof the Government of Andhra Pradesh decided to fill up the gaps by constituting State Council of Higher Education as recommended in the National Education Policy of the Government of India as also in terms of the recommendations made by the Committee constituted by the UGC. Consequently, the Government of Andhra Pradesh enacted Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education Act, 1988.

8. On the same premise which led to the declaration of 1986 Act as ultra vires the Constitution, a Writ Petition came to be filed. It by reason by the impugned judgment, was allowed by a Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court.

9. The correctness of the judgment of this Court in Osmania University Teachers Association (supra) was doubted by a two-Judge Bench inter alia on the ground that the Commissionerate Act as also the 1988 Act dealt not only with higher education but also with intermediate education and having regard to the fact that Entry 66, List I of the VII Schedule of the Constitution of India does not deal with intermediate education, the entire Act could not have been struck down. It was further opined that many of the provisions of the 1986 Act as also the impugned Act would be covered by Entry 25, List III of the VII Schedule of the Constitution of India where for the State Legislature has the requisite legislative competence.

10. The primal question which, therefore, arises for consideration is as to whether the State of Andhra Pradesh has the requisite legislative competence to enact the 1988 Act.

11. It is not in dispute that after the decision of this Court in Osmania University Teachers' Association (supra) the Committee set up by the Commission went into the matter in great details and opined that the State Act should be in aid of the UGC Act and not in derogation thereof Sufficient safeguards were provided as regards functioning of the Council so as to make the proposed enactment within the purview of Entry 25 of List III.

12. The task before this Court is, therefore, to see as to whether the defects pointed out by this Court in its earlier judgment had sufficiently been remedied so as to bring the same within the parameters of the Constitutional Scheme.

13. Before embarking upon a fuller discussion on the matter we may notice that the provisions of the 1988 Act are almost verbatim. Similar as contained in the recommendations made by the Committee set up by the UGC.

14. This Court in Osmania University Teachers' Association (supra) compared the provisions of University Grants Commission Act as also the Commissionerate Act in details and came to the following conclusion:

""23. We have extracted only such of the provisions similar to those contained in the UGC Act. That is not all. The Commissionerate Act yet contains sweeping provisions encroaching on the autonomy of the Universities. Under Section 11(1)(c) it is for the Commissionerate to decide on the need for, and location of new colleges and courses of study including Engineering Colleges. Section 11(1)(f) provides power to the Commissionerate to establish and develop resources centers for curriculum materials and continuing education of teachers. Section 11(1)(g) confers power on the Commissionerate to co-ordinate the academic activities of various institutions of higher education in the State. It is also the duty of the Commissionerate to undertake examination reforms and assume accreditation functions Section 11(1)(h) and (i)]. Section 11(1)(j) states that it is the duty of the Commissionerate to organise entrance test for University admission. Section 11(1)(k) states that it shall administer and grant scholarship and organise work study programmes. Section 11(1)(o) provides power to transfer teachers from one aided private college to another such college, subject to the rules made by the government. There is yet a devastating provision on the autonomy of Universities. Section 11(2) states that every University or college including the private college shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissionerate in regard to: (1) certain of new posts; (ii) financial management; and (iii) starting of new higher educational institutions. This 'Super Power' has been preserved to the Commissionerate notwithstanding anything contained in any law relating to Universities in the State, the Board of Intermediate Education Act. 1971 and the Andhra Pradesh Education Act. 1982.""

(Emphasis supplied)

15. This Court found that the Commissionerate Act has practically taken over the academic programmes and activities of the universities as a result whereof the universities have been rendered irrelevant if not non-entities. It was opined that both the UGC Act and the Commissionerate Act deal with the same subject matter, namely, coordination and determination of excellence in the standards of teaching and examination in the universities conveying the same meaning.

16. This Court however observed:-

""28. Before parting with the case we may say a word more. The impugned Act was the result of a report from a High Power Committee constituted by the State Government. The Committee went into the affairs of the higher education in the State. The Committee examined among other things, the curricula and courses of studies. The Committee found as a fact that there is no proper co-ordination and academic planning among the various bodies. It recommended to the State Government the need to pass a proper legislation to streamline the higher education. The Station Government accepted the recommendations and passed the Act in question. The Act now disappears for want of legislative competence. What about the need to enact that Act? It will not vanish into thin air. The defects and deficiencies pointed out by the High Power Committee in regard to higher education may continue to remain to the detriment of the interest of the State and the Nation. Such defects in the higher education may not be an isolated future only in the State of Andhra Pradesh. It may be a common feature in some other States as well.

29. That apart, we often hear and read in newspapers with disgust about the question papers leakage and mass copying in the University examinations. It has stripped the university degrees of all its credibility. He indeed must be blind who does not see what is all happening in some of the Universities.

30. The Constitution of India vests Parliament with exclusive authority in regard to co-ordination and determination of standards in institutions for higher education. The Parliament has enacted the UGC Act for that purpose. The University Grants Commission has, therefore, a greater role to play in shaping the academic life of the country. It shall not falter or fail in its duty to maintain a high standard in the Universities. Democracy depends for its very life on a high standard of general, vocational and professional education. Dissemination of learning with search for new knowledge with discipline all round must be maintained at all costs. It is hoped that University Grants Commission will duly discharge its responsibility to the Nation and play an increasing role to bring about the needed transformation in the academic life of the Universities.""

17. This exercise on the part of the Central Government and the UGC must have been undertaken in furtherance of the said observations.

18. The High Court in its impugned judgment compared the provisions of the Commissionerate Act and the impugned Act and came to the conclusion that even if the Act had been enacted in accordance with the guidelines issued by the UGC and pursuant to the recommendations made by the High Level Committee; as the State Government lacks the requisite legislative competence, it must necessarily be held to be ultra vires the Constitution.

19. Entry 66 of List I and Entry 25 of List III of VII Schedule of the Constitution of India read as follows:

""66. Coordination and determination of standards, in institutions, for higher education or research and scientific and technical institutions.

25. Education, including technical education, medical education and universities, subject to the provisions of entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 List I; vocational and technical training of labour.""

20. The conflict in legislative competence of the Parliament and the State Legislatures having regard to Article 246 of the Constitution of India must be viewed in the light of the decisions of this Court which in no uncertain terms state that each Entry has to be interpreted in a broad manner. Both the parliamentary legislation as also the State legislation must be considered in such a manner so as to uphold both of them and only in a case where it is found that both cannot co-exist, the State Act may be declared ultra vires. Clause I of Article 246 of the Constitution of India does not provide for the competence of the Parliament or the State Legislatures as is ordinarily understood but merely provide for the respective legislative fields. Furthermore, the Courts should proceed to construe a statute with a view to uphold its constitutionality. [See ITC Ltd. v. Agricultural Produce Market Committee and Ors. MANU/SC/0047/2002MANU/SC/0047/2002 : [2002]1SCR441 , Asstt. Director of Inspection Investigation v. A.B. Shanthi etc. MANU/SC/0417/2002MANU/SC/0417/2002 : [2002]254ITR258(SC) , Shri Krishna Gyanoday Sugar Ltd. and Anr. v. State of Bihar MANU/SC/0132/2003MANU/SC/0132/2003 : [2003]2SCR75 and Welfare Assocn. A.R.P., Maharashtra and Anr. v. Ranjit P. Gohil and Ors. MANU/SC/0129/2003MANU/SC/0129/2003 : [2003]2SCR139

21. Entry 66 of List I provides for coordination and determination of standards inter alia for higher education. Entry 25 of List III deals with broader subject, namely, education. On a conjoint reading of both the entries there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that although the State has a wide legislative field to cover the same is subject to entry 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I. Once, thus, it is found that any State Legislation does not entrench upon the legislative field set apart by Entry 66, List I of the VII Schedule of the Constitution of India, the State Act cannot be invalidated.

22. Section 11 and Section 16 of the 1988 Act read thus:

""Section 11. Powers and functions of the Council:

(1) It shall be the general duty of the Council to co-ordinate and determine standards in institutions of Higher Education or Research and Scientific and Technical institutions in accordance with the guidelines issued by the University Grants Commission from time to time.

(2) The functions of the Council shall include:

1. Planning and Co-ordination:

(i) to prepared consolidated programmes in the sphere of Higher Education in the State in accordance with the guidelines that may be issued by the University Grants Commission from time to time, and to assist in their implementation, keeping in view the overall priorities and perspective to Higher Education in the State.

(ii) to assist the University Grants Commission in respect of determination and maintenance of standards and suggest remedial action of Higher Education in the State;

(iii) to evolve perspective plans for development of Higher Education in the State;

(iv) to forward the Developmental Programmes of Universities and Colleges in the State to the University Grants Commission along with its comments and recommendations;

(v) to monitor the progress of implementation of such developmental programmes;

(vi) To promote co-operation and co-ordination of educational institutions among themselves and explore the scope for interaction with industry and other related establishments.

(vii) To formulate the principles as per the guidelines of the Government and to decide upon, approve and sanction new educational institutions by according permission keeping in view the various norms and requirements to be fulfilled;

(viii) To suggest ways and means of meeting additional resources for higher education in the State.

II. Academic functions:-

x x x

III. Advisory functions:-

x x x

Section 16: Annual Report: The Council shall prepare once in every year, in such form and at such time as may be prescribed an annual report giving a true and full account of its activities during the previous year, and copies thereof shall be forwarded to the Government and the Government shall cause the same to be laid before the Legislative Assembly of the State. A copy of the report shall also be sent to University Grants Commission.""

23. A bare comparison of the provisions of the 1988 Act with the provisions of the Commissionerate Act would clearly demonstrate that the powers and functions of the Council stand curtailed in so far as they are not only to function in accordance with the guidelines issued by the University Grants Commission but its duty is to assist the Commission in respect of determination and maintenance of standards and suggest remedial action of Higher Education in the State. In exercise of the power conferred upon it under the 1988 Act, the Council can now only forward the programmes of universities and colleges in the State to the University Grants Commission along with its comments and recommendations which necessarily would be subject to the letter's acceptance. Even an Annual Report prepared by the Council although is required to be forwarded to the Government which in turn is enjoined with a duty to place before the Legislative Assembly of the State, but a further requirement has been provided that a copy thereof shall also be sent to the University Grants Commission. Evidently the Commission on receipt of a copy of the report may give its own suggestions for their implementation by the Council. It is, therefore, not correct to contend as has been done by the High Court in its impugned judgment that the Council also derives its power to coordinate and determine the standards of institutions of higher education or research and technical institutions including planning and coordination to prepare consolidated programmes in the sphere of higher education in the State keeping in view the overall priorities and perspectives of higher education. Although the High Court has noticed that the principal duties and functions of the Council is to assist the UGC in respect of determination and maintenance of standards and suggest remedial action; to evolve the development programmes of Universities and Colleges in the State to the UGC along with its comments and recommendations to monitor the progress of implementation of such developmental programmes; to promote cooperation and coordination of educational institutions among themselves and to explore the scope for interaction with industry and other related establishments which not only had been done in accordance with the guidelines issued by the UGC from time to time. Despite the same it was held:

""On a comparative study of the provisions of the Act 26 of 1986 and Act 16 of 1988, the functions of the Commissionerate and the functions of the State Council well nigh are the same except to the extent of stating that the Council should act in accordance with the guidelines issued by the UGC from time to time.""

24. Once it is held that the duties and functions of the Councils are compartmentalized and they have to act in accordance with the guidelines issued by the UGC from time to time, it is preposterous to suggest that the Council acts on its own and/or at the instance of the Government in the field of cooperation and determination of standards in institutions of higher education as an independent body. Keeping in view the fact that the Commission itself on the request of the Central Government constituted a committee and laid down the parameters within which the Council can function and subjected themselves to the restriction of working within the guidelines issued by the UGC, we fail to understand as to how it can be contended that both the Commissionerate Act as also the Council Act provide for same powers and functions. The modifications made in the 1988 Act vis-a-vis the Commissionerate Act cannot be said to be so slight as has been opined by the High Court so as to arrive at a conclusion that the 1988 Act still suffers from the same vices. Having regard to the provisions of the 1988 Act and particularly Section 11 thereof we have no doubt in our mind that the purpose of the said Act, and the powers and functions thereof vis-a-vis the Commissionerate Act are absolutely distinct and different. In no way the 1988 Act can be said to have an upper hand over the UGC Act.

25. It is not a case where the State Council of Higher Education were to act independently irrespective of the standard of education set forth by the University Grants Commission. Its powers and functions, as indicated hereinbefore, are absolutely different from that of 1986 Act.

26. In R. Chitralekha v. State of Mysore MANU/SC/0030/1964MANU/SC/0030/1964 : [1964]6SCR368 Subba Rao, J. categorically held that the question as regard the impact of the Entry 66, List I and Entry 25, List III must be determined by reading the Central Act as well as the State Act conjointly. A state law providing for such standards having regard to Entry 66 of List I would be struck down as unconstitutional only in the event the same is found so heavy or devastating so as to wire out or appreciably abridge the central field and not otherwise. Once the powers and functions of the Council is found to be subject to the guidelines issued by the UGC and the perspective plan prepared by it would be subject to its approval, the question of standard of education set up by the State Act cannot be said to be leading to wipe out or appreciably abridge the central field.

27. The 1988 Act expressly states that the same would be subject to the Central Act. It emphasizes that the provisions thereof are for the purpose of filling up of the gaps and to control effectively a large number of universities within which, having regard to their sheer number, the UGC itself would not be in a position to have effectively control over them. If the UGC has an overall control over the State Council, the Central field is not entrenched upon. In a situation of this nature the doctrine of pith and substance must also be held to be applicable. We must also take notice of the fact that the State of Tamil Nadu as also the State of West Bengal in terms of the National Education Policy, 1986 as also the recommendations of the Committee framed by the University Grants Commission enacted similar Acts.

28. The provisions of the impugned Act would clearly show that the State Act is in aid of the Parliamentary Act and it does not in any manner whatsoever entrench thereupon.

29. A similar question came up for consideration in Naga People's Movement of Human Rights v. Union of India MANU/SC/0906/1998MANU/SC/0906/1998 : AIR1998SC465 wherein the law has been laid down in the following terms:

""65. .....The contention of Shri Goswami that the provisions of Sections 4 and 5 of the State Act are inconsistent with the provisions of Arms Act enacted by Parliament also cannot be accepted because the said provisions only provide for effective enforcement of the provisions of the Arms Act in the disturbed areas and it cannot be said that they, in any way, encroach upon the field covered by the Arms Act. The challenge to the validity of Sections 4 and 5 of the State Act is, therefore, negatived.""

30. Yet again in Dr. Preeti Srivastava and Anr. v. State of M.P. and Ors. MANU/SC/1021/1999MANU/SC/1021/1999 : AIR1999SC2894 , this Court held thus

""35. The legislative competence of Parliament and the legislatures of the States to make laws under Article 246 is regulated by the VIIth Schedule to the Constitution. In the VIIth Schedule as originally in force, Entry 11 of List II gave to the State an exclusive power to legislate on

""education including universities, subject to the provisions of Entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I and Entry 25 of List III"".

Entry 11 of List II was deleted and Entry 25 of List III was amended with effect from 3-1-1976 as a result of the Constitution 42nd Amendment Act of 1976. The present Entry 25 in the concurrent List is as follows:

""25. Education, including technical education, medical education and universities, subject to the provisions of Entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I; vocational and technical training of labour.""

Entry 25 is subject, inter alia, to Entry 66 of List I. Entry 66 of List I is as follows:

""66. Coordination and determination of standards in institutions for higher education or research and scientific and technical institutions.""

Both the Union as well as the States have the power to legislate on education including medical education, subject, inter alia, to Entry 66 of List I which deals with laying down standards in institutions for higher education or research and scientific and technical institutions as also coordination of such standards. A State has, therefore, the right to control education including medical education so long as the field is not occupied by any Union legislation. Secondly, the State cannot, while controlling education in the State, impinge on standards in institutions for higher education. Because this is exclusively within the purview of the Union Government. Therefore, while prescribing the criteria for admission to the institutions for higher education including higher medical education, the State cannot adversely affect the standards laid down by the Union of India under Entry 66 of List I. Secondly, while considering the cases on the subject it is also necessary to remember that from 1977, education, including, inter alia, medical and university education, is now in the Concurrent List so that the Union can legislate on admission criteria also. If it does so, the State will not be able to legislate in this field, except as provided in Article 254.""

31. In Public Service Tribunal Bar Association v. State of U.P. and Anr. MANU/SC/0062/2003MANU/SC/0062/2003 : [2003]1SCR666 , a bench of which one of us (Hon'ble CJI) was a member, it has been held:

""28.....Judicial system has an important role to play in our body politic and has a solemn obligation to fulfil. In such circumstances it is imperative upon the Courts while examining the scope of legislative action to be conscious to start with the presumption regarding the constitutional validity of the legislation. The burden of proof is upon the shoulders of the incumbent who challenges it. It is true that it is the duty of the constitutional Courts under our Constitution to declare a law enacted by the Parliament or the State Legislature as unconstitutional when the Parliament or State Legislature had assumed to enact a law which is void, either from want of constitutional power to enact it or because the constitutional forms or conditions have not been observed or where the law infringes the fundamental rights enshrined and guaranteed in Part II of the Constitution.""

32. Submission of Mr. D. Ramakrishna Reddy, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent to the effect that the 1988 Act is a colourable piece of legislation is stated to be rejected. As noticed hereinbefore the State Act seeks to plug the loopholes pointed out by this Court in Osmania University Teachers' Association (supra). It seeks to bring the State Act in conformity with the constitutional parameters. Reliance placed by Mr. Reddy on State of T.N. and Anr. v. Adhiyaman Educational & Research Institute and Ors. MANU/SC/0709/1995MANU/SC/0709/1995 : (1995)4SCC104 is equally misplaced. Therein it was found that the Tamil Nadu Private Colleges (Regulation) Act and Rules framed thereunder as also the Madras University Act entrenches upon provisions of All Indian Council for Technical Education Act, 1987 and in that situation it was held:

""30. A comparison of the Central Act and the University Act will show that as far as the institutions imparting technical education are concerned, there is a conflict between and overlapping of the functions of the council and the University. Under Section 10 of the Central Act, it is the Council which is entrusted with the power, particularly, to allocate and disburse grants, to evolve suitable performance appraisal systems incorporating norms and mechanisms for maintaining accountability of the technical institutions, laying down norms and standards for courses, curricula, staff pattern, staff qualifications, assessment and examinations, fixing norms and guidelines for charging tuition fee and other fees, granting approval for starting new technical institutions or introducing new courses or programmes, to lay down norms or granting autonomy to technical institutions, providing guidelines for admission of students, inspecting or causing to inspect colleges, for withholding or discontinuing of grants in respect of courses and programmes, declaring institutions at various levels and types fit to receive grants, advising the Commission constituted under the act for declaring technical education institutions as deemed universities, setting up of National Board of Accreditation to periodically conduct evaluation on the basis of guidelines and standards specified and to make recommendations to it or to the Council or the Commission or other bodies under the Act regarding recognition or de-recognition of the institution or the programme conducted by it. Thus, so far as these matters are concerned, in the case of the institutes imparting technical education, it is not the University Act or the University but it is the Central Act and the Council created under it which will have the jurisdiction. To that extent, after the coming into operation of the Central Act, the provisions of the University Act will be deemed to have become unenforceable in case of technical colleges like the engineering colleges. As has been pointed out earlier, the Central Act has been enacted by Parliament under Entry 66 of list I to coordinate and determine the standards of technical institutions as well as under Entry 25 of List III. The provisions of the University Act regarding affiliation of technical colleges like the engineering colleges and the conditions for grant and continuation of such affiliation by the University shall, however, remain operative but the conductions that are prescribed by the University for grant and continuance of affiliation will have to be in conformity with the norms and guidelines prescribed by the Council in respect of matters entrusted to it under Section 10 of the Central Act.""

33. The said decision ex facie is not applicable in the instant case. The law was laid down therein in the following terms:

""41. What emerges from the above discussion is as follows:

(i) The expression 'coordination' used in Entry 66 of the Union List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution does not merely mean evaluation. It means harmonisation with a view to forge a uniform pattern for a concerted action according to a certain design, scheme or plan of development. It, therefore, includes action not only for removal of disparities in standards but also for preventing the occurrence of such disparities. It would, therefore, also include power to do all th"

3. The High Court has as a consequence of its decision to permit amendment, set aside the judgment of the trial court and remanded the matter. We are of the view that even after the amendment was permitted, further question whether any fresh issue was required to be framed or fresh evidence was to be led was required to be gone into before setting aside the judgment. In case it becomes necessary to frame additional issue and permit the parties to lead further evidence, a report could be called for from the trial court on such additional issue. Remand could be ordered only if the judgment of the trial court was erroneous and the appeal court could not decide the matter and not merely on an amendment being allowed.

4. In view of the above, without expressing any opinion on merits, we set aside the impugned judgment passed by the High Court. The High Court may consider the matter afresh in accordance with law.

5. Parties shall appear before the High Court for further proceedings on 25th July, 2016.

1. The challenge in this appeal is against the order dated 21st December, 2010 passed by the Allahabad High Court by which the writ petition filed by the Appellants contesting the notifications issued Under Sections 4 read with Section 17(1) and 17(4) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (for short, ""the Act"") as well as the declaration issued Under Section 6 of the Act has been dismissed. We have heard the learned Counsels for the contesting parties and perused the relevant material.

2. The date of publication of the notification Under Section 4 of the Act by Manadi was 29.09.2007; the declaration Under Section 6 was dated 22.07.2008 while the notice Under Section 9(1) of the Act was dated 10.10.2008. The compensation on an estimated basis was deposited on 09.09.2008. The award 'was made on 12th June, 2009 and possession of the land was taken over in the month of July, 2009. Construction of the electricity substation for which purpose the land was acquired commenced in the year 2010. It is on the said facts that the writ petition was structured contending that there was no urgency to invoke Section 17 and dispense with the inquiry Under Section 5A of the Act.

3. The High Court appears to have perused the entire file in original to arrive at the conclusion that the delay in taking over the possession has been adequately explained. Furthermore, the High Court also took the view that the present would not be a fit case for interference inasmuch as co-owners have already accepted the compensation under the award and the construction of the electricity sub-station was in full progress. The High Court in considering the question of delay also took into account the fact that the land in question was covered by crops. Hence, the order of dismissal of the writ petition.

4. On the basis of the dates mentioned by us in the preceding paragraph even if we are to hold that the High Court was not justified in coming to its impugned conclusion and the dispensation of inquiry Under Section 5A of the Act in the present case cannot be justified the further question that we have to answer is whether in the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction of this Court Under Article 136 we ought to interfere with the impugned notifications at a stage when admittedly the electricity sub-station has been completed and is functional.

5. In a somewhat similar situation this Court in 'Anand Singh and Anr. v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors.' MANU/SC/0527/2010MANU/SC/0527/2010 : (2010) 11 SCC 242, has taken up the view that though dispensation of enquiry Under Section 5A was not justified, interference would not called for. Paragraph 56 of the report in Anand Singh's case (supra) wherein the aforesaid view was taken may be conveniently extracted below.

In the written submissions of the GDA, it is stated that subsequent to the declaration made Under Section 6 of the Act in the month of December 2004, award has been made and out of the 400 landowners more than 370 have already received compensation. It is also stated that out of the total cost of ` 8,85,14,000 for development of the acquired land, an amount of ` 5,28,00,000 has already been spent by the GDA and more than 60% of the work has been completed. It, thus, seems that barring the Appellants and few others all other tenure-holders/landowners have accepted the ""takings"" of their land. It is too late in the day to undo what has already been done. We are of the opinion, therefore, that in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, the Appellants are not entitled to any relief although dispensation of enquiry Under Section 5A was not justified.

6. In light of the view taken by this Court in Anand Singh's case (supra) and as the facts of the present case are largely similar, we are of the view that we ought not to interfere with the order of the High Court under challenge. The appeal, therefore, is dismissed and the order of the High Court is affirmed.

7. Before parting, we would like to observe that by an interim order dated 17th February, 2012, this Court had observed that as the construction of electricity sub-station has been completed, the compensation payable should be on the basis of market value as on the date of taking over of possession and not on the date of the Section 4 notification. Pursuant to the aforesaid order of the Court, an affidavit by the learned Additional District Magistrate (Land Acquisition), Agra (U.P.) has been filed on 17th April, 2012 before this Court wherein it has been indicated that instead of the rate of ` 42,36,540/- (Rupees forty two lakhs thirty six thousand five hundred forty only) per hectare the Appellants would be entitled to compensation at the rate of ` 49,84,165/- (Rupees forty nine lakhs eighty four thousand one hundred sixty five only) per hectare. Notwithstanding the dismissal of the appeal, we leave it open for the Appellants to receive the aforesaid compensation at the rate of ` 49,84,165/- (Rupees forty nine lakhs eighty four thousand one hundred sixty five only) per hectare, if they so desire.

A.K. Sikri, J.

1. The prosecution version, on the basis of which Respondent No. 2, along with various other persons, was chargesheeted for the offences punishable Under Sections 147, 148, 149, 302, 324 and 337 of the Indian Penal Code (for short 'Indian Penal Code') goes somewhat like this:

Respondent No. 2 Baliram Junghare (A-5) and all other accused persons were the residents of Village Hatna, Tehsil Manora, District Washim (Maharashtra). In their village, Panchayat elections were held sometime in the month of November, 1992. Two political factions, one led by Khandusing (A-1) and other by Shriram (deceased) were in the fray who had fielded their respective candidates. Party led by Khandusing emerged victorious and was elected whereas candidates set up by Shriram were vanquished in the said elections. Roughly 3-4 months thereafter i.e. 07.03.1993 is the date when the incident in question occurred. It so happened that on that day at about 7:30 p.m. at Village Hatna, Khandusing was sitting under a Neem tree on Ota. The deceased Shriram and few other persons were sitting in front of the house of one Nagorao Pawar. At that time, Respondent No. 2 Baliram along with Shankar, Bhurasing, Duryodhon, Kishor, Janardhan, Baliram Chavan, Pralhad Pawar, Vitthal Mankute, Sitaram and Vasanta came there. They were armed with sticks and stones. Seeing them, Shriram asked accused Khandusing as to what had happened. Khandusing took a stick from the hand of one of the accused and assaulted Shriram on the head i.e. vital part of his body, on account of which Shriram sustained bleeding injury. Thereafter, Respondent No. 2-Baliram assaulted Shriram by his stick on his head due to which Shriram fell down and blood started oozing profusely. All other accused persons also assaulted Shriram with sticks and stones. Thereafter, eye-witnesses Ulhas, Durgadas and Prakash along with others made an attempt to intervene and rescue Shriram. In the process, these witnesses also received injuries. The assembly pelted stones at the house of Durgadas. After accomplishing their job in this manner, all the accused persons fled from the spot. The prosecution further alleged that Shriram (father of the Appellant herein) was referred to the hospital at Manora. From there he was referred to District Civil Hospital, Akola. After receiving serious and grievous injuries, Shriram had gone into coma and did not recover therefrom. He succumbed to the injuries on 08.03.1993 at 07:15 a.m.

The police prepared the Inquest report of the dead body of Shriram on 08.03.1993 at 09:05 a.m. in the presence of the witnesses and found various injuries on the body of the deceased Shriram which were recorded in the Inquest report. Relevant portion thereof is reproduced below:

The body of the deceased was lying supine with its head towards sought and feet towards north. Left hand of the deceased was resting on the stomach and right hand was straight. Fingers of both hands of the deceased were turned inwards partly. There were small black hair on the head of the deceased, the nose and ear of the deceased were straight and both the legs were also straight. The eyes and mouth of the deceased were close. On the person of the deceased were old payjama of terrycot cloth having nadi [waist tying string] and buttons, 3 on the front side which bears blood stains from place to place, old Sando banian of cotton cloth stitched from the tailor having two pockets, which bears blood stains from place to place, old blue coloured under pant of cotton cloth having nadi [waist tying string].

While cotton bandage of the Government Hospital was seen tied around the head of the deceased, which bears blood stains. In the presence of the Pachas, when the said bandage was untried, an injury came to the notice on the left side of the head through which blood had came out. The said injury was of the size 2"" in width (approx.). On the front side of the head of the deceased was an injury through which blood had came out. It was of the side 1"" in length and "" in width (approx). Both the said injuries were appearing about "" deep.

Thin injury came to the notice extending from the lower portion of the eye upto the left ear of the deceased through which blood had come out.

2. Postmortem on the body of Shriram was conducted on 08.03.1993 by Dr. Gulab Nikam (PW-7). On that basis, the Police registered C.R. No. 35/1993 Under Sections 147, 148, 149 and 302 of Indian Penal Code against the accused persons, 12 in number. After completing the investigation, challan was filed and these accused persons were chargesheeted for various offences as mentioned earlier. After the trial, the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Washim, vide his judgment and order dated 11.09.1998 convicted Khandusing and Respondent No. 2 Baliram for offences punishable Under Sections 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, resulting in the imposition of sentence of imprisonment for life, and a fine of Rs. 1,000/- each. They were acquitted of the rest of the charges. Insofar as other 10 accused persons are concerned, they got clean acquittal in all the charges.

3. Feeling aggrieved by their conviction, Khandusing and Baliram (Respondent No. 2) filed the appeal in the High Court. However, Khandusing died during the pendency of the appeal. Thus, the appeal survived only at the instance of Respondent No. 2. The appeal came up for final arguments and after hearing the counsel for the parties, the High Court has rendered the impugned judgment dated 25.07.2014 wherein it is held that the genesis of the incident has not been established on record by credible and unimpeachable evidence. Thus, allowing the appeal of Respondent No. 2, conviction has been set aside, giving the benefit of doubt to him.

Son of the deceased Shriram has felt aggrieved by that judgment and, therefore, he has challenged the veracity and legality thereof by filing the special leave petition. Leave was granted and the matter heard finally at the time of granting leave, on the insistence of the counsel for the parties.

4. We may record at this stage that defence of the convicted accused persons was that it was an accidental death as the deceased was under the influence of liquor and had fallen down on the stony ground. The Sessions Court, however, did not accept this version as suggested by the defence and recorded the finding that in view of the ocular evidence that was produced on record, it cannot be said that it was an accidental death. Further, the death of Shriram could not be said to be a suicidal death and certainly not a natural death. It was a homicidal death.

5. At the same time, the Sessions Court also concluded that it could not be said that accused persons were the members of unlawful assembly and their common objective was to cause the death of Shriram. It was also not proved that all of them acted in furtherance of the common objective to kill Shriram or they committed rioting at the place of incident by means of deadly weapons, inasmuch as evidence of PW-1 to PW-3 itself speaks of assault on person of Shriram by means of sticks and stones only.

6. The Court of Session also noted that it was not stated by the witnesses as to which accused had executed how many blows. In the opinion of the Sessions Court, since the witnesses had described the role of accused Nos. 1 and 2 only, other accused persons could not be said to be the author of the injuries on deceased except these two accused persons and as such could not be said to be the members of unlawful assembly. It was also recorded that these accused persons had appeared with sticks and stones on the spot and except giving beating to the deceased, they did nothing of that sort which may call them rioters. On this basis, all the accused persons were acquitted of the charge of rioting.

7. The Session Judge further recorded, looking at the evidence of PW-1 Ulhas, PW-2 Durgadas and PW-3 Prakash, that all of them had stated that when they intercepted, they had also sustained injuries. Except this, their evidence does not speak about who had beaten them. Their evidence being of general nature, it is hard to say that the accused or any one of them had caused those injuries. Dr. Rathod had mentioned about the injuries on Durgadas and Prakash. Thus, the Court had no reason to say that there was any injury caused to Ulhas. In respect of allegations of pelting stones by the accused persons on the house of Nagorao Pawar and thereby acting negligently so as to endanger human life and safety of others, it was concluded that there was no evidence except the evidence of PW-3 Prakash who stated that the accused persons pelted stones on the house whereby the safety of the inhabitants was in peril. Thus, the Court was totally in disagreement with the proposition of the prosecution that offence Under Section 337 Indian Penal Code has been made out.

8. Insofar as Khandusing and Baliram are concerned, the Sessions Court came to the conclusion that they were the authors of the injuries on the person of the deceased, causing his death. It, however, held that other accused persons cannot be said to be the members of an unlawful assembly or they had acted in furtherance of common intention within the province of Section 34 Indian Penal Code and rest of the accused cannot be said to have the same intention with them or common object and, therefore, the rest of the accused are entitled to be acquitted on all the counts as the formation of unlawful assembly is not established by the prosecution and their act in prosecution of their common object or creating rioting there by means of deadly weapons and causing injuries to the other persons and pelting of stones has not been established. On these grounds, all other accused were acquitted of all the charges. By attributing specific role to Khandusing (A-1) and Baliram (A-5), the Sessions Court convicted them only, that too of charge Under Section 302 Indian Penal Code read with Section 34 Indian Penal Code. The Court specifically addressed the question as to whether the accused No. 1 and accused No. 5 had committed the offence punishable Under Section 302 Indian Penal Code. The Court stated that causing injuries by both accused No. 1 and accused No. 5 by means of sticks, one after another, on the vital body parts of the deceased i.e. head, showed that there was a common intention of both accused to cause death of Shriram.

9. As mentioned above, the High Court examined the culpability of Respondent No. 2 only since Khandusing had passed away during the pendency of his appeal. The High Court noticed that in all 7 witnesses were examined by the prosecution and out of these, 3 were the material witnesses viz. PW-1 Ulhas, PW-2 Durgadas and PW-3 Prakash. They were examined as eye-witnesses. Deceased Shriram was their Uncle and these witnesses were related to the deceased. The High Court also took note of the fact that they were two factions in the village and the incident had happened shortly after the Gram Panchayat elections. The accused persons belonged to the rival factions. In these circumstances, as per the High Court, though the evidence of these witnesses could not be discarded only on the ground of the witnesses being either partisan or related, at the same time, the Court had to be circumspect in appreciating such evidence and greater care and caution was needed while finding out whether their evidence inspired confidence. In an appropriate case, the Court would also make an attempt to look for corroboration, either direct or circumstantial in order to lend credence to the evidence of such witnesses. With the aforesaid introductory remarks, the High Court had minute and meticulous examination of the deposition of these three witnesses. In the process, it found certain material discrepancies in their statements. The Court also noticed substantial improvements made by these witnesses in their depositions as compared to the statements which they had given to the Police during investigation Under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Such aspects were duly brought out by the defence in cross examination of these witnesses. Following discussion in the impugned judgment, thereafter, needs a reproduction:

It would appear that there are substantial improvements made by P.W. 2-Durgadas in his evidence over his police statement. In this case, the prosecution has not examined the Investigating Officer, as a result the Appellants/accused were deprived of an opportunity to bring on record these improvements. Insofar as the present Appellant-Baliram is concerned, there is a general statement that he also inflicted a stick blow on the person of Shriram. Nowhere these witnesses have stated about Baliram having inflicted a stick blow on the head of the deceased. Thus, the observation to that effect in paragraph No. 39 of the impugned judgment, in our considered view, is not borne out of the evidence on record. It would be significant to note that the learned Sessions Judge has not accepted the evidence of these witnesses about the complicity of the rest of the accused whose names figured in their evidence. The learned Sessions Judge has also not accepted the prosecution case about all these accused persons having formed an unlawful assembly with the common object of committing the murder of Shriram. In order to convict the Appellants, the learned Sessions Judge has taken the aid of the provisions of Section 34 of Indian Penal Code and had found that common intention can be gathered between Khandusing and Baliram in causing the death of Shriram. We find that once the version of these material prosecution witnesses about the complicity of the other accused has not been accepted, the present Appellant could not have been convicted for the offence punishable Under Section 302 of Indian Penal Code with the aid of Section 34 of Indian Penal Code, particularly when there is no evidence on record to show that he had assaulted the deceased on his head.

10. In addition, the High Court has also pointed out some more aspects which dent the veracity of prosecution case. These are:

(a) As per the statement of Dr. Bhilsing Rathod (PW-6), Medical Officer at P.H.C. Manora who had first opportunity to examine the deceased, two injuries were found on the person of the deceased and both were simple having been caused by hard and blunt object.

(b) PW-6 had issued injury certificate (Ex. 107) and reading thereof along with statement of PW-6 showed that deceased Shriram had consumed alcohol and was under the influence of the said alcohol.

(c) Dr. Gulab Nikam (PW-7) who had conducted the autopsy on the dead body of Shriram had noticed five injuries which were recorded by him in his report which according to him were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. The High Court noted that injury No. 3 was ""Incised wound on left side of the face starting from 1 below lateral ankle of right eye, just above Toagus of left ear, size 3 Inch x  Inch x  Inch"". However, contrary to the above, insofar as PW-6 is concerned, he had noticed only two injuries on the person of the deceased on 07.03.1993 which would certainly militate against the story of assault by sticks and stones by as many as 13 persons.

Thus, medical evidence was at variance with the ocular testimonies and the evidence so led could not be accepted. Here, the medical evidence had the effect of destroying the ocular testimony itself and, therefore, the prosecution case had to fail inasmuch as findings of two simple injuries immediately after the incident in the wake of allegedly assault by as many as 13 persons would certainly create a serious dent and doubt in the prosecution version and the evidence of the so-called witnesses.

(d) According to the High Court, the genesis of the incident and mode and the manner of the assault and the role played by the individual accused did not clearly come on record.

(e) Once the evidence of material prosecution witnesses (PW-1 to PW-3) had not been accepted qua the formation of unlawful assembly by the accused persons, the conviction of Baliram Under Section 302 Indian Penal Code could not be sustained with the aid of Section 34 of Indian Penal Code, particularly so, when there was no evidence to show that Respondent No. 2 had inflicted blow on the head of the deceased, as observed by the Sessions Court.

In nutshell, aforesaid are the reasons given by the High Court while acquitting Respondent No. 2.

11. Learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that a serious error was committed by the High Court in holding that there was no evidence to show that Respondent No. 2 had inflicted blow on the head of the deceased. He drew our attention to the testimony of eye witnesses who according to him had specifically narrated the role of Respondent No. 2 in inflicting injuries on the person of the deceased. He further submitted that this aspect was specifically taken note of by the trial court while convicting Respondent No. 2. On this basis, he argued that the observations of the High Court that there was no evidence to implicate Respondent No. 2 was contrary to the record.

12. Learned Counsel for Respondent No. 2, on the other hand, stood by the reasoning that has been given by the High Court in support of its conclusion and submitted that High Court had not committed any error in arriving at the aforesaid findings. He argued that all the three eye-witnesses have stated in their depositions that Respondent No. 2 gave a blow to the deceased. In the first instance, it was their improved version as they did not say anything before the Police about the role of Respondent No. 2. Further, one witness out of the three did not even mention as to in what manner the blow was given and also did not state the weapon allegedly used by him. Other two witnesses had stated that Respondent No. 2 had given a stick blow on the person of the deceased. Thus, there was no allegation against Respondent No. 2 that he gave a blow on the head of the deceased. On the contrary, all these witnesses had specifically mentioned that Khandusing was author of head injury and postmortem report had clearly spelled out that death was caused due to head injury. He further submitted that apart from the above, High Court had also pointed out various other infirmities in the prosecution story which are of serious nature.

13. We shall first deal with the arguments of the learned Counsel for the Appellant relating to the alleged involvement of Respondent No. 2 in the commission of the act for which the accused persons were prosecuted. As noted, the argument was that Respondent No. 2 had also inflicted head injury to the deceased and the High Court has failed to notice the same. It is true that PWs-1, 2 and 3 have stated in their depositions that Respondent No. 2 gave a blow to the deceased. However, at the same time, it has also come on record that one of the witnesses has not mentioned as to in what manner the blow was given or which weapon was used. Other two witnesses have stated that a stick blow was given on the person of the deceased. Relevant portion of the depositions of these three witnesses, in this behalf, is reproduced below:

PW-1-There Khandusing took a stick from one person and inflicted a blow on the head of my Uncle. The accused Baliram Junghare beat my uncle.

PW-2-According Khandusing took a stick from hand of other person and inflicted a blow on the head of my uncle Shriram. Then accused Baliram Junghare inflicted a stick blow on the person of my uncle.

PW-3-The accused Khandusing inflicted a stick blow on the head of Shriram. Then accused Baliram Junghare inflicted a stick blow on the person of Shriram.

14. It is clear from the above that insofar as Khandusing is concerned, it is specifically stated that he gave a blow on the head of the deceased. But qua Respondent No. 2, the only allegation is that the blow was given on the 'person' of the deceased. It is not stated that Respondent No. 2 had given a blow on the head of the deceased. Even if the postmortem report is to be believed, the death was caused due to head injury. Thus, attribution qua Respondent No. 2 is that he has only given a stick blow on the body of the deceased without specifying which part thereof. It is also to be borne in mind that when the statement of these witnesses were recorded by the investigating officer Under Section 161 of Code of Criminal Procedure, they did not say anything about Respondent No. 2 and whatever is stated in the Court, as extracted above, is an improved version. Since this was the main argument of the Appellant and when we find no merit therein, the appeal is liable to fail. However, in addition, we would also like to observe that the High Court did not only go by the alleged role that was attributed to Respondent No. 2 but took into consideration the case of prosecution in its entirety and found various loopholes in the prosecution story which had already been discussed above. Suffice it is to point out that as per the prosecution case, there were as many as 13 persons, including Respondent No. 2, who formed unlawful assembly and came to the place of incident with common intention to kill Shriram. Even as per the trial court, charges pertaining to unlawful assembly or the complicity of other accused persons had not been proved and the trial court itself acquitted all the accused persons except Khandusing and Respondent No. 2. In a case like this, Respondent No. 2 cannot be convicted with the aid of Section 34 Indian Penal Code, more particularly in the absence of any allegation against him of any fatal assault.

15. In Pandurang and Ors. v. The State of Hyderabad MANU/SC/0048/1954MANU/SC/0048/1954 : 1955 SCR (1) 1083, this Court held that to attract the applicability of Section 34 of the Code the prosecution is under an obligation to establish that there existed a common intention which requires a pre-arranged plan because before a man can be vicariously convicted for the criminal act of another, the act must have been done in furtherance of the common intention of all. This Court had in mind the ultimate act done in furtherance of the common intention. In the absence of a pre-arranged plan and thus a common intention even if several persons simultaneously attack a man and each one of them by having his individual intention, namely, the intention to kill and each can individually inflict a separate fatal blow and yet none would have the common intention required by the section. In a case like that each would be individually liable for whatever injury he caused but none could be vicariously convicted for the act of any or the other. The High Court has also correctly relied on the law laid down by this Court in the case of Noor @ Nooruddin v. State of Karnataka MANU/SC/7645/2007MANU/SC/7645/2007 : (2007) 12 SCC 84 wherein this Court has held that when there was nothing on record to show that the accused had inflicted injury on the vital part of the body, Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code would not be attracted. In a case like this, it is the specific role of Respondent No. 2 which has to be established to find out what particular crime is committed by him. Though evidence of PW-1 to PW-3 does not inspire confidence insofar as Respondent No. 2 is concerned, even if it is to be accepted on its face value the role attributed to him of giving blow on the body of the deceased with stick, by no stretch of imagination it can be said that it was done with the intention to cause his death.

16. It is also to be borne in mind that PW-6 had found only three injuries on the body of the deceased which were not of serious nature. That apart, prosecution cannot also shy away from the fact that deceased was found to be under the influence of alcohol and since injury on the head was found to have been caused by a blunt object, it was possible that such a injury was caused as a result of fall on the floor.

17. When we examine the matter in all its length and breadth and in a holistic manner, we are inclined to form an irresistible opinion that conviction of Respondent No. 2 was rightly set aside by the High Court. This appeal, accordingly, fails and is hereby dismissed.

No costs.

1. This petition has been filed Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India. It prays for several directions including a direction to declare Kashmiri Pandits as ""Internally Displaced Persons"" within the meaning of the guiding principles on ""Internally Displaced persons"" adopted by 'Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights'. It also prays for a direction to the Respondents to investigate and prosecute cases of massacre and murders in terms of averments made in para 6-A, B and para 16 of the writ petition and for a direction to remove all encroachment on properties within the State of Jammu and Kashmir with a direction that properties, movable or immovable, sold by displaced persons after 1989-90 be declared as 'Distress Sales'. The petition further seeks a direction to the State Government not to acquire any property owned by any Kashmiri Pandit without the prior concurrence of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, and to provide permanent housing accommodation to all the Kashmiri minority migrants living in various parts of the country. The State of Jammu and Kashmir has filed its counter affidavit and so has the Government of India to which learned Counsel for the Petitioners has filed a rejoinder that runs into 407 pages.

2. Having heard learned Counsel for the parties at some length, we are of the view that since the writ petition seeks multifarious reliefs it will be more appropriate if the same is transferred to the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir at Jammu for hearing and disposal in accordance with law. We say so particularly because according to Mr. Sunil Fernandes, learned Counsel for the Respondent-State of Jammu and Kashmir, Matters concerning relief and rehabilitation of Kashmiri migrants is being handled by the Relief and Rehabilitation Department of the Government which is located in Jammu. It may, therefore, be more convenient to both the patties to urge all such contentions as may be open to them before the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir at Jammu where the concerned departments and the relevant record is located.

3. We accordingly transfer this petition to the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir with a request to the Chief Justice of that Court to assign the matter to an appropriate Bench so that the same are disposed off as expeditiously as possible. The parties are directed to appear before the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir through their respective counsel on Tuesday, the 5th April, 2016. The Registry is directed to despatch the record to the High Court at the earliest. No costs.

1. The appellant herein is n partnership firm and it has undertaken a contract with the respondent for construction of a flood protection wall in Hoshangabad town in the year 1974-1975.

2. It is alleged that the appellant has done some extra work and it was not paid its dues and therefore the appellant filed a suit under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act in the District Court at Hoshangabad. The learned District Judge appointed an Arbitrator. The Arbitrator after hearing the parties gave an award on 28th November, 1985 wherein the respondent was required to pay a sum of Rs. 1,04,200. The said award was filed before the District Court for being made Rule of the Court.

3. However, the respondent filed an objection stating that the Arbitrator has committed misconduct as he has gone outside the purview of the contract. The Court was of the view that since the Arbitrator has gone but of the purview of the contract and has not considered relevant clauses of the agreement and therefore he has committed misconduct. Accordingly, the Award was set aside and the District Court reduced the amount payable from Rs. 1,04,200 to Rs. 16,400.

4. Aggrieved, the appellant preferred the appeal before the High Court which was dismissed.

5. It is against the said judgment, the appellant has urged that since the Award is a non-speaking Award and non-consideration of relevant clauses of the contract would not constitute misconduct on the part of the Arbitrator and the view taken by the High Court is erroneous. We do not find any merit in the submissions.

6. In K.P. Poulose v. State of Kerala, MANU/SC/0037/1975MANU/SC/0037/1975 : AIR1975SC1259 . it was held by this Court that misconduct under Section 30(a) has not a connotation of moral lapse. It comprises legal misconduct which is complete if the Arbitrator on the face of the Award arrives at an inconsistent conclusion even on his own finding or arrives at a decision by ignoring very material documents which throw abundant light on the controversy to help a just and fair decision.

7. In the instant case the Arbitrator has misconducted the proceedings by ignoring the two very material documents to arrive at a just decision to resolve the controversy between the Department and the contractor.

8. In that view of the matter, we do not find any merit in this appeal. It is dismissed accordingly. Since no one has appeared on behalf of the respondent, there shall be no order as to costs.

J.S. Khehar, J.

1. Leave granted in Special Leave Petition (C) Nos. 7490-7491 of 2014.

2. Two company petitions, i.e., Company Petition Nos. 170 of 1995 and 35 of 1997 were filed by Videocon International Ltd. and Tapti Machines Pvt. Ltd., for winding up of Deve Sugars Ltd. before the High Court of Judicature at Madras. Deve Sugars Ltd. was running a sugar factory in the State of Karnataka. Deve Sugars Ltd. was ordered to be wound up on 16.4.1999. An Official Liquidator was accordingly directed to take possession of the properties of the company-Deve Sugars Ltd. The Official Liquidator took possession of the assets of the company situate at Harige (in District Shimoga, in the State of Karnataka), on 28.9.1999.

3. The State Bank of Mysore had also extended some loans to Deve Sugars Ltd. When Deve Sugars Ltd. defaulted in the repayment of the loans, the State Bank of Mysore filed Original Application Nos. 440 of 1997 and 1300 of 1997, before the Debts Recovery Tribunal, Bangalore, (hereinafter referred to as, the DRT, Bangalore) for the recovery of Rs. 22,31,78,558.55. During the course of the instant proceedings, the DRT, Bangalore issued a recovery certificate in the sum of Rs. 8.40 crores. It would be relevant to mention, that the State Bank of Mysore also filed Company Application Nos. 1251-1253 of 1999, in the pending Company Petition No. 170 of 1995, before the High Court at Madras, seeking leave to proceed with the recovery proceedings before the DRT, Bangalore, under the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (hereinafter referred to as, the RDB Act).

4. The Company Court in the High Court at Madras, while granting leave to the State Bank of Mysore, passed the following order on 10.3.2000 (while disposing of Company Application Nos. 1251-1253 of 1999):

This company application praying this Court to grant leave to the applicant Bank to proceed and prosecute further O.A. No. 1300 of 1997 filed by them against the Respondent Company in the Debt Recovery Tribunal at Bangalore.

Company Applications coming on this day before this Court for hearing in the presence of Mr. R. Varichandran advocate for the applicant, herein and the official liquidator, High Court, Madras, the Respondent, appearing in person, and upon reading the Judges Summons and affidavit and report of the Official Liquidator filed herein, the Court made the following orders:

Leave is granted subject to the condition that official liquidator is impleaded and no coercive steps are taken against the assets of the company during or after the conclusion of the proceedings before the Tribunal.

(Emphasis supplied)

A perusal of the above order reveals, that leave was granted, subject to the condition that the Official Liquidator, was impleaded before the DRT, Bangalore, and further, that no coercive steps would be taken against the assets of the company-Deve Sugars Ltd., during or after the conclusion of proceedings before the DRT, Bangalore.

5. On 1.8.2001, the workers' union of Deve Sugars Ltd. was granted the responsibility to overlook security arrangements of the establishment of Deve Sugars Ltd.

6. Immediately after the DRT, Bangalore, issued the recovery certificate, the State Bank of Mysore moved DCP No. 1912 in Original Application No. 440 of 1997, seeking the disposal of the assets of the company in liquidation, at the hands of the Recovery Officer of the DRT, Bangalore (hereinafter referred to as, the Recovery Officer). Simultaneously, the State Bank of Mysore being conscious of the order passed by the High Court at Madras on 10.3.2000, filed Company Application No. 1300 of 2003, with a prayer that it be permitted to seek execution of the recovery certificate dated 15.5.2002 (for recovering the amounts due to it, from out of the assets of Deve Sugars Ltd.). It is relevant to mention, that the aforesaid Company Application No. 1300 of 2003 was not entertained by the Registry of the High Court at Madras. While declining to entertain Company Application No. 1300 of 2003, the Registry of the High Court at Madras, relied upon a judgment rendered by this Court in Civil Appeal No. 2536 of 2000 (reported as Allahabad Bank v. Canara Bank MANU/SC/0262/2000MANU/SC/0262/2000 : (2000) 4 SCC 406). While not entertaining Company Application No. 1300 of 2003, the Registry of the High Court recorded the following endorsement:

ORDER

As per order in Civil Appeal No. 2536/00 as reported in 2000(3) SCC 205. Leave is not necessary.

7. Consequent upon the return of Company Application No. 1300 of 2003, it came to be assumed by the State Bank of Mysore, that leave of the High Court, was not required for the sale of the assets of Deve Sugars Ltd. Accordingly, the State Bank of Mysore approached the Recovery Officer, for the disposal of the assets of Deve Sugars Ltd., in continuation of the recovery certificate issued by the DRT dated 15.5.2002. On the above prayer of the State Bank of Mysore, the Recovery Officer issued a proclamation of sale in Form-13, by following the procedure prescribed under the RDB Act. The auction of the properties of Deve Sugars Ltd., in the first instance, was fixed for 1.10.2014.

8. At the instant juncture, the workers' union (Tungabadra Sugar Works Mazdoor Sangh), of Deve Sugars Ltd., approached the High Court of Karnataka, by filing Writ Petition No. 37991 of 2004. Through the above writ petition, the workers' union assailed the recovery proceedings initiated by the State Bank of Mysore, before the Recovery Officer. The workers' union also sought an interim direction from the High Court of Karnataka, to restrain the continuation of the sale proceedings, at the hands of the Recovery Officer, because their salary and provident fund dues, were still payable by Deve Sugars Ltd. The aforesaid prayer was made by asserting, that the workers' union had a preferential claim, as against the claim of the State Bank of Mysore, under the provisions of the Companies Act. A learned single Judge of the High Court of Karnataka, while issuing notice, directed that the sale made by the Recovery Officer would be subject to the final outcome of the writ petition. It would also be relevant to reiterate, that the Official Liquidator was authorized by the High Court at Madras, to take over possession of the properties of the company under liquidation. The Official Liquidator had accordingly taken over possession of the said properties on 28.9.1999. While permitting the State Bank of Mysore to pursue the recovery proceedings against Deve Sugars Ltd. before the DRT, the High Court at Madras, had directed that the Official Liquidator be impleaded as a Respondent before the DRT. The Official Liquidator, had also raised objections to the purported sale by the Recovery Officer (in continuation of the recovery certificate dated 15.5.2002, issued by the DRT). The Official Liquidator sought deferment of the sale proceedings at the hands of the Recovery Officer, Under Section 529A of the Companies Act. It would be relevant to mention, that the objections raised by the workers' union and the Official Liquidator, were overruled by the Recovery Officer.

9. It is also pertinent to mention, that the auction scheduled by the Recovery Officer for 1.10.2004, could not be conducted. Accordingly, a fresh proclamation was issued, for the auction of the properties of Deve Sugars Ltd., fixing 11.8.2005 as the date for holding the auction. The rival parties were also permitted to bring their buyers, if there was anyone interested. The reserve price was fixed at Rs. 10 crores. The auction was actually conducted on 11.8.2005. The highest bid was made by Anita International, the Appellant before this Court. The bid of Anita International of Rs. 10.25 crores was accepted. The bidder deposited the bid amount, within the stipulated period. No challenge was raised against the auction conducted on 11.8.2005, within the postulated period of 30 days, as is permissible in terms of the Rules framed under the RDB Act. The Recovery Officer ordered the confirmation of the sale of the auctioned property, after the expiry of statutory period, expressed in Rules 60, 61, and 62 of the Second Schedule of the Income Tax Act (as is applicable to proceedings, before Debts Recovery Tribunals), on 12.9.2005.

10. On 20.9.2005, the Recovery Officer appointed a Receiver, to take possession of the property, sold at the auction. The Court Commissioner allegedly took over possession of some of the properties, and handed over the same to the auction purchaser-Anita International. At the instant juncture, the Appellant-Anita International, filed Company Application No. 1811 of 2005 before the High Court at Madras for removal of the security agency. At the said juncture, Videocon International Ltd. and Tapti Machines Pvt. Ltd. filed Writ Petition No. 26564 of 2005 before the High Court of Karnataka. The above writ petition, and Writ Petition No. 37991 of 2004 (filed by the workers' union) were heard by a learned single Judge, wherein the auction purchaser-Anita International, raised a preliminary objection. It was submitted, that the Petitioners before the High Court had an efficacious alternative remedy, under the RDB Act. It was accordingly prayed, that the Petitioners be relegated to their alternative remedy. Company Application No. 854 of 2006 was filed before the Company Court in the High Court at Madras, wherein a challenge was raised to the sale of the assets of Deve Sugars Ltd., at the hands of the Recovery Officer. It would be relevant to mention, that the above two writ petitions were disposed of by the High Court of Karnataka, by a common order dated 27.10.2006. The Petitioners before the Karnataka High Court were allowed to avail of their alternative remedy before the DRT, Bangalore. The above common order dated 27.10.2006 was challenged, by filing Writ Appeal Nos. 2050 and 2051 of 2006. Both the above writ appeals were dismissed on 23.2.2007. Liberty was, however, reserved with Appellants, by permitting them to approach the DRT, Bangalore, by filing appeals. As a matter of abundant caution, the appellate Court ordered, that the DRT, Bangalore, would deal with the controversy, uninfluenced by the orders passed by the High Court.

11. In compliance with, and in continuation of the outcome before the High Court of Karnataka, the workers' union preferred AOR No. 15 of 2006 and Videocon International Ltd. preferred AOR No. 1 of 2007. In the above appeals, a challenge was raised to the order dated 12.9.2005 passed by the Recovery Officer, whereby the sale of the properties of Deve Sugars Ltd. conducted on 11.8.2005, in favour of Anita International was confirmed. Simultaneously, one N. Ponnusamy, an ex-Director of Deve Sugars Ltd., filed Company Application Nos. 2740-2742 of 2007 before the Company Court in the High Court at Madras, and sought the setting aside of the auction sale dated 11.8.2005, as well as, the confirmation order dated 12.9.2005, after the payment of the consideration amount. The challenge raised by N. Ponnusamy was primarily on the ground that the reserve price of Rs. 10 crore was too low. N. Ponnusamy, also sought transfer of the recovery proceedings, from the DRT, Bangalore, to the High Court at Madras. While entertaining the proceedings initiated by N. Ponnusamy, the High Court by its order dated 24.10.2007, passed an ex parte interim order of stay. Anita International and State Bank of Mysore, filed detailed objections, to the applications filed by the Official Liquidator, as well as, by the aforementioned N. Ponnusamy. All the applications filed in C.A. No. 1811 of 2005 were taken up for consideration, collectively. By a common order dated 3.3.2009, the application filed by the Official Liquidator was dismissed, by holding that the Official Liquidator was a party before the Karnataka High Court (in the proceedings which were disposed of by a common order dated 27.10.2006), and in consonance with the above order, the Official Liquidator was obliged to file an appeal, to challenge the auction sale (dated 11.8.2005), as well as, the order of confirmation (dated 12.9.2005) passed by the Recovery Officer. Likewise, the proceedings initiated by N. Ponnusamy, also did not yield any result. His claim was also rejected on the ground, that he too could have availed of the remedy of filing an appeal, to assail the orders passed by the Recovery Officer. The other applications, which came up for hearing jointly were likewise dismissed, as the said applicants, had already availed of the appellate remedy, before the DRT, Bangalore. As against the above, the application filed by Anita International for possession of the property purchased by way of auction at the hands of the Recovery Officer, was allowed.

12. Dissatisfied with the order passed by the Company Court, the applicants raised a challenge to the order dated 3.3.2009 (passed in C.A. Nos. 1811 of 2005, 854 of 2006 and 2740-2742 of 2007-in Company Petition No. 170 of 1995) by filing O.S.A. Nos. 59-63, 76, 77 and 82 of 2009. The impugned order in the present appeals dated 17.9.2009, was passed by a Division Bench of the Company Court in the High Court at Madras. In arriving at its conclusions, the High Court took into consideration inter alia the following factors:

Firstly, the Official Liquidator had raised objections before the Recovery Officer, in respect of the sale of the properties of Deve Sugars Ltd. There was nothing to indicate, that the said objections were ever considered by the Recovery Officer. Conversely, the High Court also arrived at the conclusion, that the Official Liquidator who was the custodian of the properties of Deve Sugars Ltd. (consequent upon the Official Liquidator having taken possession of the assets of the company on 28.9.1999), had failed to effectively protect the property of the company.

Secondly, no material had been placed before the High Court to indicate, that the valuation report (dated 24.3.2002) and the inventory (dated 25.11.2004) were prepared after giving notice to the Official Liquidator, who was undoubtedly in exclusive custody of the properties (which were subject matter of auction).

Thirdly, even after the workers' union had raised objections before the Recovery Officer, no material was placed before the High Court, that there was proper application of mind at the hands of the Recovery Officer, leading to the inference, that the objections were rejected in a casual and lackadaisical manner.

Fourthly, the inspection of the properties of the company under winding up, by the intending purchasers (for the auction sale scheduled on 11.8.2005) was permitted only on the day preceding the date of auction (namely, on 10.8.2005), leading to the inference, that the entire process of auction was a mere formality.

Fifthly, on the advertised date fixed for the auction (on 11.8.2005) the Recovery Officer received only two bids. Despite the above, he closed the bid on 11.8.2005 itself. Insofar as the above two bids are concerned, it was felt, that there was for all intents and purposes only a singular bid. One of the bidders was Anita International-the Appellant herein, and the other bid was by Synergy Steel Ltd.-a sister company of the Appellant-Anita International. In sum and substance therefore, the Recovery Officer closed the bid, after receiving a singular bid.

Sixthly, after holding the auction on 11.8.2005, the Recovery Officer confirmed the sale in favour of Anita International on 12.9.2005. This could not have been done, in view of the order dated 10.3.2000 passed by the High Court at Madras, wherein it was directed, that no coercive steps would be taken against the assets of the company under liquidation, during or after the conclusion of the proceedings before the DRT, Bangalore. And as such, the State Bank of Mysore could not have proceeded with, the sale of the assets of Deve Sugars Ltd.

13. While dealing with the proposition of law declared by this Court in the Allahabad Bank case MANU/SC/0262/2000MANU/SC/0262/2000 : (2000) 4 SCC 406, wherein this Court had unambiguously concluded, that the provisions of the RDB Act required, Debts Recovery Tribunals alone, to decide applications for recovery of debts due to banks and financial institutions. And wherein, it was also held, that the aforesaid responsibility included, the adjudication of the liability of the debtor to banks and financial institutions, as well as, the execution of the recovery certificate by the Recovery Officer. In spite of the above, it was submitted, that the High Court by relying on the judgment in M.V. Janardhan Reddy v. Vijaya Bank MANU/SC/7604/2008MANU/SC/7604/2008 : (2008) 7 SCC 738, and after taking note of the fact, that the State Bank of Mysore had applied to the Company Court of the High Court at Madras, for liberty to recover its dues from Deve Sugars Ltd., by filing Company Application Nos. 1251-1253 of 1999 (in pending Company Petition No. 170 of 1995), and having obtained an order from the High Court dated 10.3.2000, was bound by the same. The High Court also concluded, that the above order dated 10.3.2000 was binding, on the Recovery Officer of the DRT, Bangalore. The High Court also expressed the view, that the order dated 10.3.2000 had unambiguously directed, that no coercive steps would be taken against the assets of the company under winding up. Accordingly, the High Court held, that the State Bank of Mysore could not take advantage of the sale of the assets of the company, or the confirmation thereof at the hands of the Recovery Officer, as the same were in clear violation, of the order (dated 10.3.2000) of the Company Court in the High Court at Madras. Relying on the decision of this Court in the M.V. Janardhan Reddy case MANU/SC/7604/2008MANU/SC/7604/2008 : (2008) 7 SCC 738, the High Court while referring to the findings recorded in paragraph 28 of the above judgment concluded, that since the assets of the company under winding up were under the physical charge of the Official Liquidator, the Official Liquidator ought to have been associated with the auction proceedings, conducted by the Recovery Officer. Since the facts and circumstances of the present case reveal, that the Official Liquidator was not allowed to be associated with the auction proceedings, and even the valuation of the assets, was taken without the knowledge of the Official Liquidator, and further, the objections raised by the Official Liquidator were rejected without due consideration, the Company Court in the High Court at Madras concluded, that the sale of the properties of Deve Sugars Ltd. by the Recovery Officer on 11.8.2005, was liable to be set aside. So also, the confirmation of the sale, by the Recovery Officer on 12.9.2015.

14. Having concluded as above, the High Court vide the impugned order dated 17.9.2009, directed as under:

Hence the following judgment is made:

(i) The auction sale in question is set aside;

(ii) The auction purchaser is entitled to refund of the monies paid by him towards the auction sale which is now set aside;

(iii) In the interest of all the creditors and also the workers' union, a fresh sale is ordered to be made by the Recovery Officer after following the procedural formalities and after preparation of a fresh valuation done by the panel of valuers appointed by the Company Court with the association of the Official Liquidator and on acceptance of the same by the Company Court in order to ensure a proper price is fetched for the assets of the company in liquidation.

15. While assailing the impugned order passed by the High Court dated 17.9.2009, it was the vehement contention of learned Counsel for the Appellant, that the Company Court in the High Court at Madras, had no jurisdiction in respect of the proceedings which fell within the legitimate domain of the RDB Act. To canvass the above proposition, learned Counsel placed reliance on a number of judgments of this Court. The submissions advanced in this behalf, are being narrated hereunder:

(i) Reliance was first placed on the Allahabad Bank case MANU/SC/0262/2000MANU/SC/0262/2000 : (2000) 4 SCC 406. It was pointed out, that the above judgment was rendered on 10.4.2000. And in the above view of the matter, the declared position of law was clear and explicit well before the controversy in hand was determined by the High Court at Madras. From the cited judgment, learned Counsel for the Appellant placed reliance on the following observations:

21. In our opinion, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in regard to adjudication is exclusive. The RDB Act requires the Tribunal alone to decide applications for recovery of debts due to banks or financial institutions. Once the Tribunal passes an order that the debt is due, the Tribunal has to issue a certificate Under Section 19(22) [formerly Under Section 19(7)] to the Recovery Officer for recovery of the debt specified in the certificate. The question arises as to the meaning of the word ""recovery"" in Section 17 of the Act. It appears to us that basically the Tribunal is to adjudicate the liability of the Defendant and then it has to issue a certificate Under Section 19(22). Under Section 18, the jurisdiction of any other court or authority which would otherwise have had jurisdiction but for the provisions of the Act, is ousted and the power to adjudicate upon the liability is exclusively vested in the Tribunal. (This exclusion does not however apply to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court or of a High Court exercising power under Articles 226 or 227 of the Constitution.) This is the effect of Sections 17 and 18 of the Act.

22. We hold that the provisions of Sections 17 and 18 of the RDB Act are exclusive so far as the question of adjudication of the liability of the Defendant to the Appellant Bank is concerned.

(ii) Execution of certificate by Recovery Officer: is his jurisdiction exclusive.

23. Even in regard to ""execution"", the jurisdiction of the Recovery Officer is exclusive. Now a procedure has been laid down in the Act for recovery of the debt as per the certificate issued by the Tribunal and this procedure is contained in Chapter V of the Act and is covered by Sections 25 to 30. It is not the intendment of the Act that while the basic liability of the Defendant is to be decided by the Tribunal Under Section 17, the banks/financial institutions should go to the civil court or the Company Court or some other authority outside the Act for the actual realisation of the amount. The certificate granted Under Section 19(22) has, in our opinion, to be executed only by the Recovery Officer. No dual jurisdictions at different stages are contemplated. Further, Section 34 of the Act gives overriding effect to the provisions of the RDB Act......

xxx xxx xxx

The provisions of Section 34(1) clearly state that the RDB Act overrides other laws to the extent of ""inconsistency"". In our opinion, the prescription of an exclusive Tribunal both for adjudication and execution is a procedure clearly inconsistent with realisation of these debts in any other manner.

24. There is one more reason as to why it must be held that the jurisdiction of the Recovery Officer is exclusive. The Tiwari Committee which recommended the constitution of a Special Tribunal in 1981 for recovery of debts due to banks and financial institutions stated in its report that the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribunal must relate not only in regard to the adjudication of the liability but also in regard to the execution proceedings. It stated in Annexure XI of its report that all ""execution proceedings"" must be taken up only by the Special Tribunal under the Act. In our opinion, in view of the special procedure for recovery prescribed in Chapter V of the Act, and Section 34, execution of the certificate is also within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Recovery Officer.

Question of leave and control by the Company Court:

30. Learned Attorney General has, in this connection, relied upon Damji Valji Shah v. LIC of India MANU/SC/0230/1965MANU/SC/0230/1965 : (1965) 3 SCR 665 to contend that for initiating and continuing proceedings under the RDB Act, no leave of the Company Court is necessary Under Section 446. In that case, a Tribunal was constituted under the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956. Question was whether Under Section 446 of the Companies Act. 1956, the said proceedings could be stayed and later be transferred to the Company Court and adjudicated in that Court. It was held that the said proceedings could not be transferred. Section 15 of the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956--which we may say, roughly corresponds to Section 17 of the RDB Act--enabled Life Insurance Corporation of India to file a case before a Special Tribunal and recover various amounts from the erstwhile life insurance companies in certain respects. Section 41 of the LIC Act conferred exclusive jurisdiction on the said Tribunal just like Section 18 of the RDB Act, 1993. There the Company was ordered to be wound up by an order of the Company Court passed Under Section 446(1) on 9-1-1959. The claim was filed by LIC against the Company and its Directors before the Tribunal in 1962. The Respondents before the Tribunal contended that the claim could not have been filed in the Tribunal without the leave of the Company Court Under Section 446(1). This Court rejected the said contention and held that though the purpose of Section 446 was to enable the Company Court to transfer proceedings to itself and to dispose of the suit or proceedings so transferred, unless the Company Court had jurisdiction to decide the questions which were raised before the LIC Tribunal, there was no purpose of requiring leave of the Company Court or permitting transfer......

xxx xxx xxx

31. It may also be noticed that in the LIC Act of 1956, there was no provision like Section 34 of the RDB Act giving overriding effect to the provisions of the LIC Act. Still this Court upheld the exclusive jurisdiction of the LIC Tribunal.....

xxx xxx xxx

71. But the point here is that the occasion for such a claim by a secured creditor (here Canara Bank) against realisations by other creditors (like Allahabad Bank) Under Section 529-A read with proviso (c) to Section 529(1) can arise before the Tribunal only if Canara Bank has stood outside winding-up and realised amounts and if it shows that out of the amounts privately realised by it, some portion has been rateably taken away by the liquidator under Clauses (a) and (b) of the proviso to Section 529(1). It is only then that it can claim that it is to be reimbursed at the same level as a secured creditor with priority over the realisations of other creditors lying in the Tribunal. None of these conditions is satisfied by Canara Bank. Thus, Canara Bank does not belong to the class of secured creditors covered by Section 529-A(1)(b).

xxx xxx xxx

73. If none of the conditions required for applying Section 19(19) and Section 529-A is therefore, satisfied, then the claim of Canara Bank before the Tribunal can only be on the basis of principles underlying Section 73 Code of Civil Procedure. There being no decree in its favour from any court or from any Tribunal, and the other conditions of Section 73 not having been satisfied, no dividend can be claimed out of monies realised at the instance of Allahabad Bank, even if ' Allahabad Bank is an unsecured creditor.

xxx xxx xxx

76. The next question is whether the amounts realised under the RDB Act at the instance of the Appellant can be straight away released in its favour. Now, even if Section 19(19) read with Section 529-A of the Companies Act does not help the Respondent Canara Bank, the said provisions can still have an impact on the Appellant Allahabad Bank which has no doubt a decree in its favour passed by the Tribunal. Its dues are unsecured. The ""workmen's dues"" have priority over all other creditors, secured and unsecured because of Section 529-A(1)(a). There is no material before us to hold that the workmen's dues of the Defendant Company have all been paid. In view of the general principles laid down in National Textile Workers' Union v. P.R. Ramakrishnan MANU/SC/0025/1982MANU/SC/0025/1982 : (1983) 1 SCC 228 there is an obligation resting on this Court to see that no secured or unsecured creditors including banks or financial institutions, are paid before the workmen's dues are paid. We are, therefore, unable to release any amounts in favour of the Appellant Bank straight away.

(Emphasis supplied)

Based on the above decision, it was the contention of learned Counsel for the Appellant, that the Company Court in the High Court at Madras, had neither the jurisdiction to grant liberty to the State Bank of Mysore to recover its dues from Deve Sugars Ltd. by initiating proceedings under the RDB Act, nor the jurisdiction to interfere with the recovery proceedings by directing that no coercive steps would be taken against Deve Sugars Ltd., during or after the conclusion of the proceedings before the DRT, Bangalore. Stated simply, learned Counsel for the Appellant was emphatic, that the order passed by the Company Court in the High Court at Madras (dated 10.3.2000), was jurisdictionally and legally impermissible, and as such, was liable to be ignored.

(ii) Reliance was also placed on Andhra Bank v. Official Liquidator MANU/SC/0203/2005MANU/SC/0203/2005 : (2005) 5 SCC 75. The instant judgment was relied upon to support the conclusions drawn by learned Counsel, while placing reliance on the Allahabad Bank case MANU/SC/0262/2000MANU/SC/0262/2000 : (2000) 4 SCC 406. Learned Counsel invited our attention to the position expressed in paragraph 19 of the cited judgment, which is extracted hereunder:

19. As regards Point (6), however, this Court at para 76 of the judgment held:

The next question is whether the amounts realised under the RDB Act at the instance of the Appellant can be straight away released in its favour. Now, even if Section 19(19) read with Section 529-A of the Companies Act does not help the Respondent Canara Bank, the said provisions can still have an impact on the Appellant Allahabad Bank which has no doubt a decree in its favour passed by the Tribunal. Its dues are unsecured. The 'workmen's dues' have priority over all other creditors, secured and unsecured because of Section 529-A(1)(a). There is no material before us to hold that the workmen's dues of the Defendant Company have all been paid. In view of the general principles laid down in National Textile Workers' Union v. P.R. Ramakrishnan MANU/SC/0025/1982MANU/SC/0025/1982 : (1983) 1 SCC 228 there is an obligation resting on this Court to see that no secured or unsecured creditors including banks or financial institutions, are paid before the workmen's dues are paid. We are, therefore, unable to release any amounts in favour of the Appellant Bank straight away.

(Emphasis supplied)

(iii) In chronological order, learned Counsel next relied upon the judgment in Rajasthan State Financial Corporation v. Official Liquidator MANU/SC/1033/2005MANU/SC/1033/2005 : (2005) 8 SCC 190, and drew the Court's attention to the following:

15. In A.P. State Financial Corpn. v. Official Liquidator MANU/SC/0491/2000MANU/SC/0491/2000 : (2000) 7 SCC 291 this Court held that the Company Judge, while permitting the financial corporation to stay outside the liquidation proceedings, rightly imposed conditions to ensure that the Corporation would: (i) discharge its liability due to workers Under Section 529-A of the Companies Act, (ii) inform the Official Liquidator in advance about the proposed sale of properties of the indebted companies, and (iii) would obtain the Court's permission before finalising the tenders. This Court specifically overruled the view taken by the High Court that it was not necessary for the financial corporations to seek permission of the Company Court to stay outside the winding-up proceedings. It was held that Sections 529(1) and 529-A of the Companies Act had overriding effect and the 1985 amendment being later in point of time, the non obstante Clause therein would prevail over the non obstante Clause contained in Section 46-B of the SFC Act.

16. In International Coach Builders Ltd. v. Karnataka State Financial Corpn. MANU/SC/0189/2003MANU/SC/0189/2003 : (2003) 10 SCC 482 this Court considered the correctness of the views expressed by the Karnataka High Court and the Gujarat High Court. This Court held that a right is available to a financial corporation Under Section 29 of the SFC Act against a debtor, if a company, only so long as there is no order of winding up. When the debtor is a company in"

1. These petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution of India was filed because of the Bulletin of Information issued by the University of Delhi for the academic session 2001, whereby and whereunder following the judgment of this Court in Dr. Parag Gupta v. University of Delhi and Ors. MANU/SC/0300/2000MANU/SC/0300/2000 : AIR2000SC2319 it was stipulated that the candidates who have passed the MBBS Examination in an University other than Delhi University having been allotted the same under 15% quota by the Director General, Health Services would also be eligible if he/she is permanent resident of the National Capital Territory of Delhi.

2. The grievance of the petitioner is that on account of different standards adopted by different States, the students are suffering great hardship and in fact there is no rationale in not allowing the students who might be the residents of one State but who have undertaken their Undergraduate study in some other State on being selected through a competitive examination on All India basis, to get preferential right in obtaining admission in post-graduate course.

3. This Court by a three-Judge Bench considered the question of admission to the Medical Colleges as well as reservation of seats for residents of the State or students of same University laboratory in the case of Dr. Pradeep Jain v. Union of India MANU/SC/0047/1984MANU/SC/0047/1984 : (1984)IILLJ481SC . So far as the admission to Post Graduate Course is concerned, the Court held that for admission to Post Graduate Courses it would be eminently desirable not to provide for any reservation based on requirement of residence within the State or on institutional preference. Having said so, the Court went on further to hold that having regard to broader considerations of equality of opportunity and institutional continuity in education which has its own importance and value, we would direct that though residence requirement within the State shall not be a ground for reservation in admissions to post-graduate courses, a certain percentage of seats may in the present circumstances be reserved on the basis of institutional preference in the sense that a student who has passed MBBS course from a medical college or university may be given preference for admission to the post graduate course in the same medical college or university but such reservation on the basis of institutional preference should not in any event exceed 50 per cent of the total number of open seats available for admission to the post-graduate course. We are not concerned with the other observations made in the aforesaid case since in the case in hand we are also concerned only with the admission to the post-graduate course. The aforesaid decision unequivocally indicates that even though it would be ideal not to have any reservation either on residence requirement or on institutional preference but the students passing out their under-graduate study from a University should have some preferential treatment and it is in that context the aforesaid observation has been made. It may be stated that in the aforesaid case before disposing of the matter all States were duly noticed and those who had entered appearance, their contentions were taken into account and finally the matter stood disposed of, as stated above.

4. In the case of Dr. Dinesh Kumar and Ors. (II) v. Motilal Nehru Medical College, Allahabad and Ors. MANU/SC/0073/1986MANU/SC/0073/1986 : [1986]3SCR345 the aforesaid percentage which was indicated in Pradeep Jain's case (supra) was altered as it was felt that the percentage indicated there is on the higher side. In Dinesh Kumar's case (supra) it was held that number of seats which should be made available for admission on the basis of All India Entrance Examination should be changed which necessarily relates to the admission into MBBS course and it was held that not less than 15% of the seats in each medical college or institution, without taking into account any reservation validly made, shall be filled on the basis of All India Entrance Examination. It was further held that the same formula must apply also in regard to admissions to post graduate courses and instead of making available for admission on all India basis 50% of the open seats after taking into account reservations validly made, we would direct that not less than 25% of the total number of seats without taking into account any reservations shall be made available for being filled on the basis of All India Entrance Examination. In dealing with the admission to the post graduate course the Court has all along been insisting for excellence and yet trying to balance the equity by considering the case of some preferential treatment to the students who were educated from the same university. When the case of Dr. Parag Gupta (supra) came up for consideration before this Court before a two-Judge Bench, looking at the hardship which the applicant was facing on account of the residence as a condition precedent for admission into post-graduate course which was in relation to Tamil Nadu, to resolve the impasse, the Court held that even those students who have gone out of their home States to pursue study elsewhere on all India quota should be allowed to participate to compete in their home-States where they have their roots, to pursue post-graduate studies.

5. Be it stated that the aforesaid conclusion of the judgment of two learned Judges of this Court was in the peculiar facts of that case and it became necessary to hold that view because of the condition of residence being insisted upon in the State of Tamil Nadu where the very applicant had pursued his undergraduate study on being selected on the basis of an All India Entrance Examination in respect of 15% quota available to be filled up in the undergraduate course. Had the State of Tamil Nadu followed the direction of this Court in Pradeep Jain's case, the aforesaid contingency would not have arisen.

6. In the aforesaid judgment in paragraph 8 their Lordships have enumerated indicating which State has adopted what nature of preference and from that it is clear that the States of Assam, Tamil Nadu, Goa and Karnataka have adopted the preference on account of residence whereas most of the other States have adopted the preference on the institutional basis. In view of the judgment of the three-Judges Bench in Pradeep Jain case (supra), it must be held that the aforesaid decision of the States of Assam, Tamil Nadu, Goa and Karnataka conferring preference on the basis of the residence was not warranted under law inasmuch as to have a uniformity throughout the country and in the larger interest of all concerned taking into account the pattern of admission to undergraduate course and also the excellence that is required for admission to the post graduate course the only preference that should be adopted by all States is the institutional preference, as was indicated in Pradeep Jain's case. It would be necessary for us to take into consideration yet another judgment of this Court in Dr. Prachi Almeida v. Dean, Goa Medical College and Ors. MANU/SC/0524/2001MANU/SC/0524/2001 : AIR2001SC3418 which arises out of an admission to the Goa Medical College wherein the Court followed the earlier decision in Dr. Parag Gupta's case (supra) and held that the petitioner therein having been selected in the 15% All India quota and having been allotted a seat in the State of Goa wherefrom she obtained graduation, her case should not be ignored on the basis of non-fulfilment of residential requirement. In fact, therefore, their Lordships apparently followed Pradeep Jain's case though it has not been stated so in so many words. It would be, at this stage, appropriate to notice yet another judgment of a three-Judge Bench in State of U.P. v. Vineet Singh and Ors. MANU/SC/0546/2000MANU/SC/0546/2000 : AIR2000SC2766 where a stray observation has been made to the effect that there is no conflict between the Pradeep Jain's case and Parag Gupta's case. Be it stated that in that particular case the Court was in fact not required to examine the issue that arose in Pradeep Jain or Parag Gupta's cases and answered in those two cases. A bare look at the judgment of the 3-Judge Bench in Pradeep Jain's case and two-Judge Bench in Parag Gupta's case in relation to the question of preference in the post graduate course it cannot but be held that the Parag Gupta's case took a different view by upholding the residential preference, in essence, which was contrary to the judgment of the three-Judge Bench in Pradeep Jain's case. Independently on examining the 7 issue of preference, we are also of the considered opinion that the decision rendered by this Court in Pradeep Jain's case had taken a correct criteria into consideration and we therefore, agree with the principles evolved and the ratio given in Pradeep Jain's case SQ far as it relates to admission into the post graduate courses and the question of institutional preference to be given to those who had studied their undergraduate courses in the very institution as against the 15% quota on the All India basis. In this view of the matter, the impugned Bulletin of Information issued by the Delhi University in relation to the Post-doctoral (D.M./M.Ch.) Post Graduate Degree must be held to be contrary to the direction of this Court in Pradeep Jain's case and the same is accordingly quashed. However, this order shall be made effective from the next academic session. We however direct the States of Assam, Tamil Nadu, Goa and Karnataka to follow the pattern of institutional preference as has been indicated by this Court in Pradeep Jain's case and reiterated by us today. These petitions stand disposed of accordingly.

V. Gopala Gowda, J.

1. I.A. No. 2 of 2015 in C.A. No. 247 of 2009 for substitution of the name of the Appellant-Company is ordered.

2. These appeals are directed against the common impugned judgment and order dated 16.8.2007 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in Writ Petition No. 444 of 2007, whereby the High Court quashed the order of the Deputy Commissioner of Labour, Mumbai, dated 14.8.2006 and directed him to refer the industrial dispute of the concerned workmen as per their demand dated 14.11.2005, for adjudication of the matter to the Industrial Tribunal Under Section 10(1)(d) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (for short ""the Act"").

3. Since both the appeals are filed against the common impugned judgment and order of the High Court, for the sake of convenience, we would refer to the brief facts of C.A. No. 246 of 2009 which are stated hereunder:

The Appellant-Company, M/s. Ariane Orgachem Pvt.. Ltd. was established to manufacture and market drugs which are manufactured by it. The Appellant-Company, have taken over the alleged loss incurring pharmaceutical factory of M/s. Wyeth Ltd. Respondent No. 3 herein (Appellant-Company in C.A. 247 of 2009), situated at 146, LBS Marg, Ghatkopar, Mumbai, along with its permanent employees, pursuant to an agreement dated 25.6.2004 and the sale deed dated 30.6.2004. The letters were issued to the workmen by the Appellant in this regard, to the effect that they would be employed under its management without any interruption in their services.

4. On 30.08.2004, the Appellant-Company acquired the erstwhile manufacturing facility of M/s. Wyeth Ltd.-Respondent No. 3 and on 31.8.2004, the Respondent No. 3 issued letters to its workmen working in its erstwhile factory, informing them about the sale and transfer of the ownership and management of the said factory to the Appellant-Company in accordance with the provision of Section 25-FF of the Act. They were further informed that their services will not be interrupted due to such transfer and their services will be treated as continuous and uninterrupted for the purpose of retiral/terminal benefits. Thereafter, all the workmen whose employment came to be transferred from M/s. Wyeth Ltd. to the Appellant-Company started drawing their wages/salary and all other benefits like advance, LTA and leave, etc. from the Appellant.

5. On 2.9.2004, the Respondent No. 1-Wyeth Employees Union (for short ""the Union""), which is the recognized Union under the Provisions of the Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions and Prevention of Unfair Labour Practices Act, 1971 (for short ""the MRTU & PULP Act""), filed Complaint (ULP) No. 534 of 2004, before the Industrial Court challenging the sale and transfer of employment of the employees but no interim relief was granted by the Industrial Court, hence, all the workmen came on the rolls of Appellant-Company and started drawing wages from it.

6. The Appellant claimed that it has framed Voluntary Retirement Scheme (for short ""VRS"") on 12.4.2005 for the workmen, offering amounts, tax free, to each workman with all other dues such as gratuity, ex-gratia, provident fund, leave encashment etc. which was operative from 12.4.2005 to 30.4.2005. On 15.04.2005, 45 out of the total 143 workmen applied for the said VRS and collected the VRS payments and the remaining workmen collected the VRS payments on 20.04.2005 and 21.04.2005. After the payment of the VRS benefits, the workmen were relieved from their services by the Appellant-Company.

7. It is further stated by the Appellant-Company that on 26.4.2005, the first Respondent-Union through its General Secretary, unconditionally withdrew Complaint (ULP) Nos. 534 of 2004, 714 of 2004 and 771 of 2004, confirming to the court that all the workmen had availed the VRS and the Union did not want to pursue the cases.

8. After several months of accepting the VRS, the Respondent-Union raised the demand seeking their reinstatement in the Company of Respondent No. 3. In response to the said demand, the Appellant-Company replied that all the workmen had taken the VRS benefits and they were not the workmen of either the Appellant-Company or the third Respondent's Company anymore, therefore, no industrial dispute could be raised by or on their behalf by the Respondent-Union. On 12.12.2005, the Respondent-Union, wrote a letter to the Assistant Commissioner of Labour, seeking his intervention in respect of their demand with the Company. On 01.08.2006, the Conciliation Officer sent the failure report to the Assistant Commissioner of Labour, subsequent to which on 14.08.2006, the office of the Deputy Labour Commissioner which took cognizance of the failure report declined to make an order of reference to the Industrial Tribunal stating thereby that there was no industrial dispute in existence between the parties.

9. Thereafter, the newly elected leadership of the first Respondent-Union under the representation of its new General Secretary aggrieved by the order of refusal to make an order of reference to the Industrial Tribunal by the Deputy Commissioner of Labour filed Writ Petition No. 444 of 2007 before the High Court urging various legal grounds and questioning the correctness of the same.

10. The High Court in exercise of its power quashed the order dated 14.8.2006 passed by Deputy Commissioner of Labour, Mumbai, who has refused to make an order of reference to the Industrial Tribunal for its adjudication of the industrial dispute between the parties. The High Court has held that the acceptance of the benefits by the concerned workmen from the Appellant may not establish the fact that no force or compulsion was exercised by the Appellant and this is the most contentious and disputed question of fact which could not have been decided by the State Government in exercise of its administrative power. The High Court has held that the subjective satisfaction of the subject matter of an industrial dispute between the parties by the State Government is therefore, vitiated in law and making an order of reference in respect of the concerned workmen is absolutely essential in this regard. Thus, the High Court by issuing a writ of mandamus, directed the Deputy Labour Commissioner to make an order of reference to the Industrial Tribunal with regard to the demand of industrial dispute raised by the Union dated 14.11.2005 on behalf of the concerned workmen, for its adjudication Under Section 10(1)(d) of the Act. Aggrieved by the impugned judgment of the High Court, these appeals have been filed by the Appellant-Companies, praying this Court to set aside the same contending that the High Court has exceeded its jurisdiction in passing the impugned judgment and order.

11. It is urged by Mr. C.U. Singh, the learned senior Counsel on behalf of the Appellant-Company that the VRS benefits were accepted by the concerned workmen between 15.4.2005 to 25.4.2005 and the cheques which were issued to them towards their voluntary retirement benefits were encashed by them. Therefore, raising the industrial dispute by the concerned workmen after lapse of 7 months, from the date of acceptance of the VRS benefits, is wholly untenable in law. It has been further contended by him that many concerned workmen have cleared their bank loans such as housing loans, Co-operative Society/Co-operative bank loans and the Appellant-Company has received intimations from the Banks/Societies to stop deducting and remitting loan instalments from their salaries.

12. It has been further contended by him that the former Joint Secretary of the Respondent No. 1-Union had withdrawn the Complaint (ULP) Nos. 534 of 2004 and 714 of 2004 and Complaint (ULP) No. 771 of 2004, after stepping into the witness box and confirming to the Court that all the workmen had availed the VRS benefits and the first Respondent-Union did not wish to pursue the cases. Therefore, the demand raised by the first Respondent-Union on behalf of the concerned workmen through its General Secretary contending that they have not availed the VRS benefits under the scheme is only an afterthought and the same does not amount to an industrial dispute and therefore, there is no dispute for the Industrial Tribunal to adjudicate. The Deputy Labour Commissioner has rightly arrived at the conclusion on the basis of the facts on hand and declined to make an order of reference to the Industrial Tribunal for adjudication of the same. This important aspect of the case has not been taken into consideration by the High Court while quashing the order of refusal to make an order of reference to the Industrial Tribunal and it has erroneously issued a writ of mandamus to the Deputy Commissioner of Labour against the Appellant by directing him to make an order of reference of the industrial dispute on the demands raised by first Respondent-Union on behalf of the concerned workmen.

13. It is further contended by the learned senior Counsel on behalf of the Appellant that the first Respondent-Union has not made any allegation against the Appellant, regarding the alleged coercion and fraud played by the Appellant in obtaining the voluntary retirement letters, either in the demands submitted to the Appellant or before the Conciliation Officer. Therefore, raising the said contention by the first Respondent-Union for the first time before this Court, without it being first raised before the Industrial Tribunal and the Conciliation Officer is not permissible in law as held by this Court in the case of Bishundeo Narain and Anr. v. Seogeni Rai and Anr. MANU/SC/0059/1951MANU/SC/0059/1951 : (1951) SCR 548 Further, it is contended that in view of Section 59 of the MRTU and PULP Act, there is an express bar on the first Respondent to raise an industrial dispute against the Appellant-Company. This legal aspect of the case has been considered by this Court in the cases of Mahabir Jute Mills Ltd., Gorakhpur v. Shri Shibban Lal Saxena and Ors. MANU/SC/0350/1975MANU/SC/0350/1975 : (1975) 2 SCC 818 and Govind Sugar Mills Ltd. and Anr. v. Hind Mazdoor Sabha and Ors. MANU/SC/0363/1975MANU/SC/0363/1975 : (1976) 1 SCC 60. Further, the said allegations made by the first Respondent-Union with regard to the alleged coercion upon the concerned workmen by the Appellant is not factually correct and the same cannot be considered by this Court as it is a frivolous and incorrect statement of fact made on behalf of the first Respondent-Union with a view to raise frivolous industrial dispute against the Appellant-Company and the Respondent No. 3.

14. The learned senior Counsel has further placed reliance upon the following decisions of this Court in Bank of India and Ors. v. O.P. Swarnakar and Ors. MANU/SC/1179/2002MANU/SC/1179/2002 : (2003) 2 SCC 721, A.K. Bindal and Anr. v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0349/2003MANU/SC/0349/2003 : (2003) 5 SCC 163, Punjab National Bank v. Virender Kumar Goel and Ors. MANU/SC/0044/2004MANU/SC/0044/2004 : (2004) 2 SCC 193, Punjab and Sind Bank and Anr. v. S. Ranveer Singh Bawa and Anr. MANU/SC/0382/2004MANU/SC/0382/2004 : (2004) 4 SCC 484 and Bank of India and Ors. v. K.V. Vivek Ayer and Anr. (2006) 9 SCC 177 in support of the proposition of law that once the VRS is obtained and accepted by the concerned workmen along with all other monetary benefits, the same would amount to availing benefits of the scheme and no claim can be made by the concerned workmen against the employer for its reconsideration and no order of reference can be made for the industrial dispute by the appropriate government as the same does not exist for adjudication. Therefore, the principle of estoppel is applicable on the concerned workmen to raise an industrial dispute against the Appellant-Company and the Respondent No. 3 herein on the subject matter of voluntary retirement, for the reason that once they have accepted the voluntary retirement from their services and withdrawn all the monetary benefits which were paid to them by the Appellant, they cannot raise the industrial dispute in this regard as the same is not permissible in law. He has further placed reliance upon the judgments of this Court in the cases of Gyanendra Sahay v. Tata Iron and Steel Co. Ltd. MANU/SC/3044/2006MANU/SC/3044/2006 : (2006) 5 SCC 759 and Vice-Chairman and Managing Director, A.P.S.I.D.C. Ltd. and Anr. v. R. Varaprasad and Ors. MANU/SC/0412/2003MANU/SC/0412/2003 : (2003) 11 SCC 572, wherein the aforesaid principles of law have been reiterated by this Court.

15. Further, it has been contended by him that the scope of judicial review power of the High Court to examine the order passed by the State Government in exercise of its administrative power in the writ petition is very limited as has been held by this Court in the cases of Secretary, Indian Tea Association v. Ajit Kumar Barat and Ors. MANU/SC/0081/2000MANU/SC/0081/2000 : (2000) 3 SCC 93 and ANZ Grindlays Bank Ltd. v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/1579/2005MANU/SC/1579/2005 : (2005) 12 SCC 738. Therefore, the learned senior Counsel has submitted that the impugned judgment and order is required to be interfered with by this Court in exercise of its jurisdiction as the exercise of judicial review power by the High Court is bad in law which cannot be allowed to sustain.

16. On the other hand, Mr. Sanjay Singhvi, the learned senior Counsel on behalf of the first Respondent-Union has sought to justify the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court contending that the Deputy Labour Commissioner acting as a delegatee of the State Government has erroneously refused to make an order of reference to the Industrial Tribunal on the demands raised by the workmen and he has committed a grave error in law and therefore, the High Court has rightly exercised its extraordinary and supervisory jurisdiction and quashed the same by issuing a writ of mandamus. The learned senior Counsel has further contended that the Deputy Commissioner of Labour in fact and in law is not a delegatee of the State Government and therefore, he could not have legally made an order of refusal to make an order of reference of the industrial dispute to the Industrial Tribunal for its adjudication. It has been further contended by him that the signatures of the concerned workmen were obtained on blank papers and there was no VRS scheme introduced by the Appellant. Hence, the question of seeking voluntary retirement from their services does not arise. Further, the Respondent No. 3-M/s. Wyeth Ltd., the Company in which the concerned workmen were working initially had intimated the stock exchange about the stoppage of its manufacturing operations at the Company's plant at LBS Marg, Ghatkopar, Mumbai. Therefore, it is clear that the said Company wanted to discontinue and close down the factory and terminate the services of the concerned workmen from their services. However, being a profitable Company, with profit making operations, the Company has resorted to achieve its end through a subterfuge by obtaining the signatures of the concerned workmen on the blank papers by using undue influence, coercion etc. in order to circumvent the provisions of Section 25(O) of the Act. Therefore, the alleged voluntary retirement of the concerned workmen, is a disputed question of fact, as the workmen are contending that they have not voluntarily submitted any application for voluntary retirement from their services to the Appellant-Company which fact is seriously disputed by the Appellant and therefore, the same is required to be adjudicated by the competent Industrial Tribunal and not referring the said dispute between the parties by the State Government to it is an arbitrary and unjustified exercise of power which is not within the jurisdiction of the State Government, in exercise of its administrative power under the provisions of Section 10(1)(d) read with the Third Schedule of the Act. For the above reason itself, the High Court is justified in quashing the impugned order in the writ petition by passing the impugned judgment and order which does not warrant interference by this Court in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction in these appeals.

17. It has been further contended by the learned senior Counsel for the first Respondent-Union that the Appellant-Company is owned and controlled by the Runwal group, which is a builder/developer and it has entered into a sham arrangement with M/s. Wyeth Ltd. on 30.8.2004 purporting it to be an alleged transfer of the ownership of its undertaking in favour of the Appellant. However, it is a transfer of the assets of the Company only without the transfer of the business of the Appellant in the connected appeal (Respondent No. 3 herein) and the same cannot be said to be a genuine transfer of undertaking of M/s. Wyeth Ltd. in accordance with law and in terms of Section 25FF of the Act. The said action of Appellant-Company and the Respondent No. 3 herein is in violation of the provisions of Section 25(O) of the Act.

18. Thus, it is urged by the learned senior Counsel that in view of the aforesaid reasons the question of the alleged transfer of the workmen from M/s. Wyeth Ltd. to the Appellant-Company is only a ruse and was done only with a view to acquire the property for real estate development. Therefore, the factual contentious issue of the alleged voluntary retirement of the concerned workmen and the acceptance of the monetary benefits by them need to be adjudicated by the competent Industrial Tribunal under an order of reference of the industrial dispute which has to be referred by the State Government. This aspect of the matter has not been considered by the State Government at the time of passing an order declining to exercise its administrative power to make an order of reference to the Industrial Tribunal for its adjudication of the existing industrial dispute between the workmen and the employer effectively.

19. Further, it has been contended by the learned senior Counsel that the alleged VRS benefits said to have been given to the concerned workmen is a false plea pleaded by the Appellant-Company before the Conciliation Officer to justify their illegal action and the same requires scrutiny by the Industrial Tribunal on the basis of the evidence that has to be adduced by the parties. The findings of fact need to be recorded by it after adjudication of the dispute that is required to be referred to it by the State Government in exercise of its administrative power under the provisions of the Act.

20. It has been further contended by the learned senior Counsel on behalf of the first Respondent that after the resignation of the earlier General Secretary of the first Respondent-Union was accepted, a new Committee of the Respondent-Union was elected. Thereafter, it decided to take up the issue of illegal termination of services of the concerned workmen by the Appellant-Company. Further, the Deputy Labour Commissioner, who has acted as the delegatee of the State Government, has not looked into the fact that it took about 2 to 3 months for the new Committee of the first Respondent-Union to take over the affairs of the Union which was running under the guidance of its former General Secretary and to act in the matter of the forced termination of the concerned workmen from their services. The petition submitted to the Conciliation Officer by the Respondent-Union specifically pleads that ""neither any voluntary scheme was ever framed nor published by the Appellant"" and the concerned workmen have not retired from their services voluntarily. This aspect of the matter has not been taken into consideration by the Conciliation Officer as well as the appropriate State Government at the time of passing the order refusing to make an order of reference to the Industrial Tribunal for adjudication of the industrial dispute. The State Government has also not noticed the relevant fact that the former General Secretary, without the proper authorisation from either the first Respondent-Union or the concerned workmen, withdrew the earlier complaints referred to supra, filed on behalf of the concerned workmen. Further, the State Government has failed to consider the fact that the Appellant-Company has stated about the VRS being published for the concerned workmen for the first time, only before it and not before the Conciliation Officer in the earlier proceedings. Further, due to coercion and fear, the workmen were compelled to sign on the blank papers and the purported voluntary retirement letters alleged to have been submitted to the Appellant were not considered by it. The first Respondent-Union called upon the Appellant-Company to produce the Resolution passed by its Board before the Conciliation Officer, with regard to the alleged VRS and the order of approval said to have been granted by the Income Tax Authority for such scheme. The same were not produced by the Appellant before the Conciliation officer. The State Government at the time of passing its order ought to have considered this important factual aspect of the matter before refusing to pass an order to make a reference to the Industrial Tribunal regarding the dispute between the parties in relation to their illegal termination. For this reason also, the High Court is justified in quashing the order of refusal to make an order of reference and therefore, it is rightly justified in issuing a writ of mandamus to the State Government to make an order of reference to the jurisdictional Industrial Tribunal for adjudication of the industrial dispute between the parties.

21. The learned senior Counsel has further urged that the failure report of the dispute was addressed to the Additional Commissioner by the Conciliation Officer on 1.8.2006, but the Deputy Commissioner of Labour called for the file from the Conciliation Officer and declined to exercise his power Under Section 10(1)(d) read with the Third Schedule of the Act, without adverting to a single contention urged on behalf of the workmen in the petition submitted before the Conciliation Officer by the first Respondent-Union. The non-consideration of the claim made by the Respondent-Union on behalf of the concerned workmen by the Deputy Commissioner of Labour at the time of refusing to pass an order of reference, not only vitiates the impugned order in the writ petition on account of non application of mind by the alleged delegatee of the State Government but also vitiated in law for the reason that the Deputy Commissioner of Labour is not the competent officer to make an order of reference to the Industrial Tribunal or to refuse to make an order of reference to the Industrial Tribunal or the Industrial Tribunal. The Additional Commissioner of Labour is the only competent authority who is the delegatee of the State Government as per the notification dated 9.8.2003 issued by the Ministry of Labour, Government of Maharashtra and therefore, he alone could have passed an order of reference Under Section 10(1)(d) of the Act. Thus, the order of refusal to make an order of reference of the existing industrial dispute between the parties to the Industrial Tribunal is void ab initio in law as the same has not been exercised by competent officer as the delegatee of the State Government. On this ground itself the impugned judgment and order of the High Court is justified in quashing the order of refusal to make an order of reference regarding the industrial dispute to the Industrial Tribunal.

22. With reference to the above mentioned rival legal contentions urged on behalf of the parties, we have carefully examined the impugned judgment and order, with a view to find out whether the High Court is justified in quashing the order of refusal to make an order of reference regarding the industrial dispute raised by the first Respondent-Union on behalf of the concerned workmen to the Industrial Tribunal for its adjudication. We answer the same in the affirmative in favour of the first Respondent-Union for the following reasons:

It is an undisputed fact that the concerned workmen are the employees of M/s. Wyeth Ltd. who is the Respondent No. 3 herein and the Appellant in the connected appeal. The contention urged by the learned senior Counsel on behalf of the Respondent-Union is that the alleged transfer of the undertaking of M/s. Wyeth Ltd. in favour of the Appellant-Company is not a genuine transfer and it is a sham one, as it is a transfer of the assets of the Company only not the transfer of business of M/s. Wyeth Ltd. Therefore, the same is not in conformity with the provisions of Section 25FF of the Act. This aspect of the matter requires adjudication by the Industrial Tribunal in order to find out the correctness of the plea, whether the transfer of the undertaking M/s. Wyeth Ltd. in favour of the Appellant is genuine or not and whether the concerned workmen have accepted the retiral benefits and other monetary claims voluntarily, as pleaded by the Appellant. This complicated question of fact and law could not have been decided by the alleged delegatee of the State Government in exercise of its administrative power, as he is not the competent authority on behalf of the State Government to make an order of reference to the Industrial Tribunal. The conclusion arrived at by the High Court is supplemented with the reasons arrived at by this Court. Therefore, quashing of the order of refusal to make an order of reference by the High Court is perfectly legal and valid which need not be interfered with by this Court in exercise of its jurisdiction.

23. The other important factual aspect of the case is whether the voluntary retirement of the concerned workmen was forced or not is required to be produced by the parties before the Industrial Tribunal for its detailed examination and scrutiny. The fact that certain documents were sought to be summoned at the instance of first Respondent-Union during the conciliation proceedings from the Appellant-Company by the Conciliation Officer which were not produced by it is one more important factor which is required to be considered by the Industrial Tribunal Under Section 10(1)(d) read with the Third Schedule of the Act in exercise of its original jurisdiction to resolve the disputed questions of fact. Further, the VRS produced on record by the Management gives it the discretion to arbitrarily fix the compensation varying from Rs. 50,000/- to Rs. 7,11,000/-, which if proved, would be considered as arbitrary and there would be a grave miscarriage of justice to the concerned workmen. This aspect of the matter has been ignored by the Deputy Labour Commissioner, who has erroneously refused to make an order of reference to the Industrial Tribunal for its adjudication of the existing industrial dispute.

24. Further, there are serious allegations made against the Appellant-Company by the workmen regarding the alleged coercion, undue influence and force used on them for obtaining their signatures on blank papers, which needs to be examined very carefully by the Industrial Tribunal after recording evidence from both the parties. Prima facie, the absence of documentary evidence produced by the Appellant-Company to show that the VRS was framed by it and converting the signatures of the concerned workmen obtained on the blank papers amounts to forced termination of the services of the concerned workmen which is a disputed question of fact which requires adjudication by the competent Industrial Tribunal and therefore, the demand regarding the alleged termination of the concerned workmen is required to be referred to the Industrial Tribunal by the State Government. The non consideration of this aspect of the matter in the order dated 14.08.2006 passed by the Deputy Labour Commissioner highlighting only the factual aspect pleaded by the Appellant-Company unilaterally and not referring to the facts pleaded on behalf of the concerned workmen by the first Respondent-Union is once again totally marred by non application of mind on the part of the Deputy Commissioner of Labour, apart from the fact that the Deputy Labour Commissioner has no competency to exercise his power under the provisions of Section 10(1)(d) of the Act, either to make reference or to refuse to make reference to the Industrial Tribunal. On the above grounds also, the impugned judgment and order of the High Court is not required to be interfered with by this Court in these appeals. Reliance has been placed upon the decision of this Court by the learned senior Counsel on behalf of the first Respondent-Union in the case of National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Boghara Polyfab Pvt. Ltd. MANU/SC/4056/2008MANU/SC/4056/2008 : (2009) 1 SCC 267, wherein this Court has held thus:

26. When we refer to a discharge of contract by an agreement signed by both parties or by execution of a full and final discharge voucher/receipt by one of the parties, we refer to an agreement or discharge voucher which is validly and voluntarily executed. If the party who has executed the discharge agreement or discharge voucher, alleges that the execution of such discharge agreement or voucher was on account of fraud/coercion/undue influence practiced by the other party and is able to establish the same, then obviously the discharge of the contract by such agreement/voucher is rendered void and cannot be acted upon. Consequently, any dispute raised by such party would be arbitrable.

25. Further, the failure report of the conciliation proceedings is not the sufficient material evidence to arrive at the conclusion by the State Government to decline to exercise its statutory power under the provisions of Section 10(1)(d) read with the Third Schedule of the Act either to make/or not to make an order of reference. The refusal to make an order of reference by the State Government's delegatee amounts to determination of the existing dispute between the parties by the State Government in the absence of relevant and material evidence on record which ought not to have been done by him while exercising his power Under Section 10(1)(d) of the Act. In this regard, the High Court has rightly placed reliance upon the case of Ram Avtar Sharma and Ors. v. State of Haryana and Anr. MANU/SC/0228/1985MANU/SC/0228/1985 : (1985) 3 SCC 189, the relevant para of which reads thus:

11. The appropriate Government being the Central Government in this case declined to make a reference as per its order dated December 9, 1983 in which it is stated that 'the action of the management in imposing on the workmen penalty of removal from service on the basis of an enquiry and in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Railway Servants (Discipline & Appeal) Rules. 1968 is neither malafide nor unjustified. The appropriate Government does not consider it necessary to refer the dispute to the Industrial Tribunal for adjudication.' Ex facie it would appear that the Government acted on extraneous and irrelevant considerations and the reasons hereinbefore mentioned will mutatis mutandis apply in respect of present order of the Government under challenge. Therefore for the same reasons, a writ of mandamus must be issued.

12. Accordingly all the writ petitions are allowed and the rule is made absolute in each case. Let a writ of mandamus be issued directing the appropriate Government in each case namely the State of Haryana in the first mentioned group of petitions and the Central Government in the second petition to reconsider its decision and to exercise power Under Section 10 on relevant and considerations germane to the decision. In other words, a clear case of reference Under Section 10(1) in each case is made out.

26. Further, the High Court has rightly adverted to various judgments of this Court including Bombay Union of Jornalists v. State of Bombay MANU/SC/0135/1963MANU/SC/0135/1963 : AIR 1964 SC 1617 wherein it was held thus:

6...it would not be possible to accept the plea that the appropriate Government is precluded from considering even prima facie the merits of the dispute when it decides the question as to whether its power to make a reference should be exercised Under Section 10(1) read with Section 12(5), or not. If the claim made is patently frivolous, or is clearly belated the appropriate Government may refuse to make a reference. Likewise, if the impact of the claim on the general relations between the employer and the employees in the region is likely to be adverse, the appropriate Government may take that into account in deciding whether a reference should be made or not. It must, therefore, be held that and prima facie examination of the merits cannot be said to be foreign to the enquiry which the appropriate Government is entitled to make in deal"

U.U. Lalit, J.

1. Leave granted.

2. This appeal challenges the judgment and order dated 04.1.2011 passed by the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi in Crl. M.C. No. 460 of 2009.

3. That the facts leading to the filing of this appeal are as under:

(A) On the basis of specific information AIR Customs Officers (Preventive) at IGI Airport, New Delhi, on 09.07.1996 recovered and seized from meal trolleys of the aircraft of Lufthansa Airlines flight from Frankfurt to Delhi, 184 gold biscuits of ten tolas each, weighing 21454.400 grams valued at Rs. 1,09,84,652/- concealed in the meal trolleys by two passengers, named Varyam Singh and Ranbir Singh. In their statements, Varyam Singh and Ranbeer Singh admitted the recovery and seizure of gold and named other persons involved in the incident. Varyam Singh, inter alia, disclosed the name of one Pramod Kumar i.e. the Respondent herein who invested the money with him in the seized gold as well as the gold smuggled on earlier occasions.

(B) Varyam Singh further stated that on 6.07.1996, Ranbeer Singh and he went to Dubai where the Respondent delivered two packets of gold; that they went to Frankfurt; that in the flight from Frankfurt to Delhi with the help of Ranbeer Singh, he put both the packets in dry ice trays and as per pre-arrangement these packets were to be removed and delivered to him near Moti Bagh Gurudwara by the catering staff and that he had agreed to pay Rs. 50,000/- for this job to that person; that he had to hand over this gold to the Respondent and in return he was to get Rs. 2,00,000/- out of the profit; that his share of investment in the gold seized on 9.7.1996 was Rs. Thirty Two lacs and that the balance was invested by the Respondent. He admitted that earlier he had gone to Frankfurt via Dubai and come back to Delhi on six occasions and brought gold in the same manner. The authorities recorded the statements of all the persons involved. However, the statement of the Respondent could not be recorded as inspite of numerous summons, he did not cooperate with the investigating authorities and remained in hiding.

(C) The Commissioner of Customs, Delhi accorded sanction on 04.09.1996 for the prosecution of the Respondent, Varyam Singh, Ranbeer Singh and four others and accordingly Complaint No. 66/1/96 was filed in the Court of ACMM, New Delhi. The Respondent was declared ""proclaimed offender"" by the Ld. ACMM, New Delhi in the subject case.

(D) In the meantime adjudicating proceedings were initiated pursuant to the show cause notice to the Respondent. Order in Original No. 66/99 dated 30.09.1999 was passed by the Additional Commissioner of Customs, IGI Airport, New Delhi imposing penalty of Rs. 15 lacs on the Respondent. Following observations in the said order are noteworthy:

In response to summons Shri Kanwar Bhan appeared before the Customs authorities and he in his further voluntary statement dated 30.8.1996 recorded Under Section 108 of the Customs Act, 1962, stated that he was shown the record of details of call charges of Mobile phone number 9811028643 obtained from Essar Cell Phone mobile phone services, that on 21.04.1996 and 27.04.1996 telephone calls were made to telephone number 6914037; that he had been told that telephone number 6914037 belonged to Shri Varyam Singh and was his residence number and who had been arrested for smuggling of 184 gold biscuits. On being asked about that he stated that neither did he know any person by name of Shri Varyam Singh nor his telephone number on being asked about as to how telephone calls were made to telephone number 6914037 on 21.04.1996 three times and one time on 27.04.1996 from his mobile phone, he stated that he did not know the exact date but in the month of April, 1996, his younger brother Shri Pramod Kumar came to Delhi from Dubai as his mother was seriously ill, it might be possible that Shri Pramod Kumar had made four calls from his (Kanwar Bhan) mobile phone to telephone number 6914037 belonging to Shri Varyam Singh as he did not know Shri Varyam Singh and his telephone number.

(E) The aforesaid order dated 30.09.1999 was carried in appeal and the Commissioner of Customs (Appeal) vide his order dated 25.01.2008 set aside the penalty imposed on the Respondent. The Appellate Authority was of the view that there were two persons having same name i.e. Pramod Kumar, one in Dubai and the second being the Respondent and that beyond the statement of the co-accused there was no material on record. During the course of this order it was observed as under:

If the investment was made by Shri Pramod Kumar of Dubai, then it cannot be linked to the Appellant. The department has not made Shri Pramod Kumar of Dubai a party in the case and nothing is on record to suggest that efforts were made to trace and identify Shri Pramod Kumar of Dubai and how the telephone number in Dubai i.e. 531228 is linked to the Appellant.

Thus there is only the lone statement of Shri Varyam Singh alleging the involvement of the Appellant and is not corroborated by the statement of any other person or by any documentary evidence. On the other hand the claim of the Appellant that he had left India on 06.09.1994 and since then he has not visited India again is corroborated by the statements of various persons tendered Under Section 108 of the Customs Act 1962 and also by documentary evidence i.e. copies of his passports. No other person involved in the case has mentioned anything about the Appellant. Thus the statement of Shri Varyam Singh who himself accepted as evidence whereas the claim of the Appellant is supported by way of corroborative statements Under Section 108 of the Customs Act 1962 and documentary evidence is acceptable as credible evidence in his favour. Moreover the Appellant has not laid any claim on the impugned gold under seizure in this case.

Keeping the above in view the finding of the Adjudicating Authority about the Appellant are not fair, legal and based on facts and hence the penalty imposed on the Appellant is hereby set aside.

(F) Based on the observations and findings rendered in the aforesaid order dated 25.01.2008, a petition Under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure being Crl. M.C. No. 460 of 2009 was filed on behalf of the Respondent in the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi. It is relevant to note that in the petition itself two addresses of the Respondent were given, one of Dubai and the other of Delhi. The affidavit in support of the petition was filed by none other than Shri Kanwar Bhan, the brother of the Respondent. It was submitted on behalf of the Department that the Respondent had not joined investigation and as such the instant petition did not deserve any consideration and that there were not two Pramod Kumars but only one person having two addresses. The High Court by its judgment and order under appeal, allowed the petition and quashed Complaint No. 66/1/96 pending before the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, New Delhi. It was observed by the High Court as under:

The entire evidence sought to be relied upon by the Respondent department against the Petitioner is the same, that was before the Appellate Authority and since the Appellate Authority had considered the entire evidence and come to above conclusion, I consider that no useful purpose would be served by continuing with the prosecution against the Petitioner before the trial court.

4. The exoneration of the Respondent in the adjudication proceedings was the basis for petition Under Section 482 Code of Criminal Procedure. and such exoneration certainly weighed with the High Court. In Collector of Customs v. L.R. Melwani MANU/SC/0279/1968MANU/SC/0279/1968 : (1969) 2 SCR 438, question Nos. 1 & 2 posed before the Constitution Bench of this Court were as under:

(i) Whether the prosecution from which these criminal revision petitions arose is barred Under Article 20(2) of the Constitution as against accused 1 and 2 in that case by reason of the decision of the Collector of Customs in the proceedings under the Sea Customs Act?

(ii) Whether under any circumstance the finding of the Collector of Customs that the 1st and 2nd accused are not proved to be guilty operated as in issue estoppel in the criminal case against those accused?

5. The observations of the court in respect of aforesaid questions were as under:

8 ...The Rule laid down in that decision was adopted by this Court in Pritam Singh v. State of Punjab, and again in N.R. Ghose v. State of W.B. But before an accused can call into aid the above rule, he must establish that in a previous lawful trial before a competent court, he has secured a verdict of acquittal which verdict is binding on his prosecutor. In the instant case for the reasons already mentioned, we are unable to hold that the proceeding before the Collector of Customs is a criminal trial. From this it follows that the decision of the Collector does not amount to a verdict of acquittal in favour of accused 1 and 2.

6. A subsequent three-Judge Bench in K.G. Premshankar v. Inspector of Police MANU/SC/0771/2002MANU/SC/0771/2002 : (2002) 8 SCC 87 considered the effect of the decision of a civil court on criminal proceedings and it was concluded as under:

30. ...What emerges from the aforesaid discussion is-(1) the previous judgment which is final can be relied upon as provided Under Sections 40 to 43 of the Evidence Act; (2) in civil suits between the same parties, principle of res judicata may apply; (3) in a criminal case, Section 300 Code of Criminal Procedure. makes provision that once a person is convicted or acquitted, he may not be tried again for the same offence if the conditions mentioned therein are satisfied; (4) if the criminal case and the civil proceedings are for the same cause, judgment of the civil court would be relevant if conditions of any of Sections 40 to 43 are satisfied, but it cannot be said that the same would be conclusive except as provided in Section 41. Section 41 provides which judgment would be conclusive proof of what is stated therein.

31. Further, the judgment, order or decree passed in a previous civil proceeding, if relevant, as provided under Sections 40 and 42 or other provisions of the Evidence Act then in each case, the court has to decide to what extent it is binding or conclusive with regard to the matter(s) decided therein....

32. In the present case, the decision rendered by the Constitution Bench in M.S. Sheriff case would be binding, wherein it has been specifically held that no hard-and-fast Rule can be laid down and that possibility of conflicting decision in civil and criminal courts is not a relevant consideration. The law envisages 'such an eventuality when it expressly refrains from making the decision of one court binding on the other, or even relevant, except for limited purpose such as sentence or damages'.

7. The exoneration in related adjudication proceedings and the effect thereof on criminal proceedings again came up for consideration before a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Radheshyam Kejriwal v. State of West Bengal and Anr. MANU/SC/0134/2011MANU/SC/0134/2011 : (2011) 3 SCC 581. In his dissenting opinion P. Sathasivam, J. (as the learned Chief Justice then was) concluded that there was nothing in Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 to indicate that a finding in adjudication is binding on a court in prosecution Under Section 56 of Act or that the prosecution Under Section 56 depended upon the result of the adjudication under the Act. C.K. Prasad J., speaking for the majority summed up as under:

38. The ratio which can be culled out from these decisions can broadly be stated as follows:

(i) Adjudication proceedings and criminal prosecution can be launched simultaneously;

(ii) Decision in adjudication proceedings is not necessary before initiating criminal prosecution;

(iii) Adjudication proceedings and criminal proceedings are independent in nature to each other;

(iv) The finding against the person facing prosecution in the adjudication proceedings is not binding on the proceeding for criminal prosecution;

(v) Adjudication proceedings by the Enforcement Directorate is not prosecution by a competent court of law to attract the provisions of Article 20(2) of the Constitution or Section 300 of the Code of Criminal Procedure;

(vi) The finding in the adjudication proceedings in favour of the person facing trial for identical violation will depend upon the nature of finding: If the exoneration in adjudication proceedings is on technical ground and not on merit, prosecution may continue; and

(viii) In case of exoneration, however, on merits where the allegation is found to be not sustainable at all and the person held innocent, criminal prosecution on the same set of facts and circumstances cannot be allowed to continue the underlying principle being the higher standard of proof in criminal cases.

8. The majority judgment in Radheyshyam Kejriwal v. State of West Bengal and Anr. MANU/SC/0134/2011MANU/SC/0134/2011 : (2011) 3 SCC 581 is relied upon by the Respondent in support of the submission that the exoneration in the present case being on merits, criminal prosecution on the same set of facts ought not to be allowed to continue. Ms. Ranjana Narayan, learned Advocate appeared for the Appellant while Mr. Naveen Malhotra, learned Advocate appeared for the Respondent. We have considered rival submissions and gone through the record which brings out following crucial facets:

(a) The order in original dated 30.09.1999 referred to the statement of Kanwar Bhan, the brother of the Respondent, which clearly suggests that the Respondent had come down to Delhi in April, 1996. This statement is not even referred to in the appellate order dated 30.09.1999 but a finding is rendered that the Respondent had not visited India after September, 1994.

(b) The Respondent was declared a proclaimed offender and had not participated in any of the proceedings personally. In the circumstances no weightage could be given to copies of the passport submitted in support of the assertion that he had not visited India after September 1994.

(c) The appellate order further discloses that the statement of Varyam Singh did allege the involvement of the Respondent. In law, if such statement is otherwise admissible and reliable, conviction can lawfully rest on such material.

(d) The finding in the appellate order that there were two Pramod Kumars, is completely incorrect and unstateable.

In the back drop of these facts it cannot be accepted that the exoneration of the Respondent in the adjudication proceeding was on merits or that he was found completely innocent.

9. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that the High Court was not right and justified in accepting the prayer for quashing of the proceedings. We, therefore, allow this appeal and set-aside the view taken by the High Court. Case No. 66/1/96, on the file of the ACMM, New Delhi, shall be proceeded with, in accordance with law.

Y.K. Sabharwal, J.

1. The appellant, who was plaintiff No.4 in the suit, entered into an agreement dated 8th September, 1966 with Respondent No.1 and 2 for the purchase of Flat No. 71, on the 7th Floor of the building known as 'Divya Prabha' situated at 12-A, Foreshore Road, Bombay. The sale consideration payable under the agreement is Rs. 60,000/-. The agreement stipulated that the building was to be completed and possession of the flat delivered to the appellant by 30th June, 1969 up to which time, the appellant had already paid Rs. 35,000/- out of the sale consideration leading a balance of Rs. 25,000/- Just a few days before the date fixed for completion and delivery of possession, the lease of the plot of land on which the flats were being constructed was cancelled by the Bombay Municipal Corporation. At that stage, the building was incomplete. Admittedly, it is incomplete till date.

2. Similar agreements in respect of different flats were also entered into by the sellers with other flat purchasers. On 30th July, 1969, a suit, out of which the present appeal has arisen, was filed seeking specific performance of the flat purchase agreements. The plaintiffs other than plaintiff Nos. 4 and 7 settled their case with sellers during the pendency of the suit and plaintiff No.7 also settled during pendency of the appeal before the Division Bench of the High Court. There was, however, no settlement between the plaintiff-appellant and respondents 1 and 2. In the decision of the suit, learned Single Judge of the High Court held that the appellant was always ready and willing to perform her part of the contract and it was the sellers who committed breach in not carrying out the terms of the agreement. Learned Single Judge was, however, of the view that the grant of specific performance being discretionary remedy in equity, taking into account several and serious imponderability and further considering that huge sums may be required to complete the building, which amount cannot be properly assessed, the appellant was not entitled to the relief of specific performance and instead it was directed that the seller shall pay to the appellant damages as assessed by the Commissioner for taking accounts with interest at 6% per annum from the date of the decree till the date of payment/realization, in addition to the repayment of Rs. 35,000/- with interest thereon at 9% per annum from 4th October, 1967 till the date of decree and for the subsequent period, at 6% per annum till the date of payment/realization. The judgment and decree of the learned Single Judge was affirmed by a Division Bench of the High Court in appeal. Aggrieved therefrom, the present appeal was filed on grant of leave.

3. The appeal was heard by a two Judge Bench. The learned Judges have concurred that the appellant is entitled to the specific performance of the agreement dated 8th September, 1966. There has, however, been difference of opinion between learned Judges on the condition in respect of additional amount that may be paid by the appellant to respondent Nos.1 and 2 and, therefore, the matter has been placed before this three Judge Bench. The opinions of the learned Judges are reported in Nirmala Anand v. Advent Corporation (P) Ltd. and Ors. MANU/SC/0455/2002MANU/SC/0455/2002 : AIR2002SC2290 . In the opinion expressed by brother Justice Doraiswamy Raju, the appellant has been directed to pay a sum of Rs. 40,00,000/- in addition to the sum already paid to respondents 1 and 2 and in the view of the brother Justice Ashok Bhan, it would be unfair to impose the condition of payment of Rs. 40,00,000/- and the appellant is entitled to specific performance of agreement to sell on the price mentioned in the agreement.

4. We have heard learned counsel for the parties. The only question to determine is as to whether the appellant shall be directed to pay to respondents 1 and 2 any additional sum and if so what amount.

5. The appellant is prepared and willing to take possession of the incomplete flat without claiming any reduction in the purchase price and would not hold respondent Nos. 1 and 2 responsible for anything incomplete in the building. It has been concurrently held that she did not commit breach of the agreement to sell. She has always been ready and willing to perform her part of the agreement. The appellant is ready and willing to pay to respondents 1 and 2 interest on sum of Rs. 25,000/-. The breach was committed by respondents 1 and 2 as noticed hereinbefore. It is evident that the appellant is ready to take incomplete flat and pay further sum as noticed, most likely on account of phenomenal increase in the market price of the flat during the pendency of this litigation for over three decades. We see no reason why the appellant cannot be allowed to have, for her alone, the entire benefit of manifold mega increase of the value of real estate property in the locality. In our view, it would not be unreasonable and inequitable to make the appellant the sold beneficiary of the escalation of real estate price and the enhanced value of the felt in question. There is no reason why the appellant, who is not a defaulting party, should not be allowed to reap to herself the fruits of increase in value.

6. It is true that grant of decree of specific performance lies in the discretion of the court and it is also well settled that it is not always necessary to grant specific performance simply for the reason that it is legal to do so. It is further well settled that the court in its discretion can impose any reasonable condition including payment of an additional amount by one party to the other while granting or refusing decree or specific performance. Whether the purchaser shall be directed to pay an additional amount to the seller or converse would depend upon the facts and circumstances of a case. Ordinarily, the plaintiff is not to be denied the relief of specific performance only on account of the phenomenal increase of price during the pendency of litigation. That may be, in a given case, one of the consideration besides many others to be taken into consideration for refusing the decree of specific performance. As a general rule, it cannot be held that ordinarily the plaintiff cannot be allowed to have, for her along, the entire benefit of phenomenal increase of the value of the property during the pendency of the litigation. While balancing the equities, one of the consideration to be kept in view is as to who is the defaulting party. It is also to be borne in mind whether a party is trying to take undue advantage over the other as also the hardship that may be caused to the defendant by directing the specific performance. There may be other circumstances on which parties may not have any control. The totality of the circumstances is required to be seen.

7. In the present case, the suit was filed by the plaintiff within a month of the date when the possession under the agreement was to be delivered to her. By that time, she had already paid more than 50% of the sale consideration. There was no occasion for her to pay the balance consideration to the seller. The courts have concurrently found that the appellant has always been ready and willing to perform her part of the contract and the seller committed breach is not carrying out the terms of the agreement. While others left, the appellant has been single handedly fighting for her rights under the agreement. She has agreed to take the flat on as-is-where-is basis without claiming any reduction in purchase price and without making the seller liable for anything incomplete in the building. Further the building except the flat in question has been sold by respondents 1 and 2 to the 7th respondent. For the revival of the building plans, revival of lease and other such steps, the sellers and/or their assignees may have to take steps as per agreement between them but to ask the appellant to pay to respondent Nos. 1 and 2, a sum of Rs. 40,00,000/- would be too onerous and would almost amount to denying her specific performance. It would also amount to putting a premium on the breach committed by respondents 1 and 2. Along with the remaining amount of the sale consideration, the appellant can also be directed to pay to respondents 1 and 2 some reasonable additional amount they having been deprived of that amount of Rs. 25,000/- during all these years.

8. Having regard to the totality of circumstances, we would direct the appellant to pay to respondents 1 and 2 a sum of Rs. 6,25,000/- instead of Rs. 25,000/-. the amount of Rs. 40,00,000/-, wherever it appears in the opinion of Justice Doraiswamy Raju, would be read as Rs. 6,25,000/-. All other conditions will remain.

9. The appeal is accordingly allowed and the impugned judgment and decree of the High Court shall stand modified and altered and there shall be a decree in Suit No. 744 of 1969 on the file of the original side of the High Court, Bombay in the following terms:

(i) There shall be conditional decree for specific performance of the agreement dated 8-9-1966 entered into between the 4th plaintiff and Defendants 1 and 2 and Defendants 1 and 2 shall execute a sale deed as envisaged in the agreement for sale of Flat No. 71 on 7th Floor of the building known as ""Divya Prabha"" situated at No.12-A, Foreshore Road, Bombay on ""as-is-where-is condition.""

(ii) That the appellant-plaintiff 4, within a period of six weeks, shall pay the defendants-respondents 1 and 2, a sum of Rs. 625,000/- (Rupees six lakh and twenty five thousand only) in addition to the sum already paid by her. The appellant shall be entitled to have the sale deed executed in her favour only on prior compliance and satisfaction of this condition.

(iii) The rights and interest in the land shall be as agreed to between parties and as ber scheme and arrangement contained in the agreement dated 8-9-1996.

(iv) Defendants 1 and 2 and/or the 7th respondent in this appeal viz. Gaurav Overseas Private Ltd., 92, Maker Chambers, Nariman Point Bombay - 400020, as and when they secure the necessary renewal of the lease and revalidation of the building plan, the same shall be for the benefit of the appellant-Plaintiff 4 also, subject to the condition that shall contribute her share of the monetary commitments and expenses incurred therefore, on being intimated by any of them in writing within four weeks from the date of such receipts of the intimation. In case of dispute about the quantum, the same shall be got determined and settled before the Commissioner for taking accounts, on being moved by either of them. The sum so determined shall be a charge on the property comprised in Flat No.71, till it is paid and shall be entitled to be recovered, accordingly.

(v) The appellant and the 7th respondent shall be at liberty to mutually agree for completion of the incomplete building at such prevailing market rates as would be applicable for the work and manner of its completion and the mode of payment. If there can be no such mutual agreement among the appellant and the 7th respondent in this regard, as and when the sale deed is executed by the 1st and 2nd defendants, as per this decree, the appellant shall be at liberty to make her own arrangement to have her flat completed through approved and licensed architects.

(vi) The sale/conveyance pursuant to the decree in the suit shall be subject to all such rights and liabilities and obligations of respective parties (the appellant, respondents 1, 2 and 7) under the suit agreement, as are available to each of them against the others, had the sale been effected even without the intervention of this Court, by mutual agreement of partiee.

(vii) The appellant failing to comply with the terms of the conditional decree passed as above, shall stand denied and lose her right and entitlement to get specific performance of the agreement dated 8-9-1966 in her favour and consequently, the appeal shall stand dismissed with the appellant's right secured as per the judgments and decrees dated 23-3-1981 and 15-7-1087 firmly affirmed and settled, and the rights to have them executed in the manner known to law, alone surviving to the appellant.

(viii) Each party shall bear their respective costs in this Court.

10. The appeal is allowed in above terms.

V.N. Khare, C.J.

1. The appellants herein are the tenants. The landlord brought a suit for eviction of the tenant, inter alia on the ground of personal necessity as well as far default in payment of rent. The trial court dismissed the suit. However, the first appellate court allowed the appeal of landlord and thus the suit on the ground of default was decreed. The second appeal, by the tenants, was dismissed. The High Court held that mere acceptance of delayed rent by the Landlord did not amount to waiver of the right which was accrued to him under the Act and also the tenant has committed default in payment of the rent. It is against the said judgment, the tenants preferred present appeal by means of a special leave petition.

2. When the matter camp up before a Bench of this Court, the Bench was of the view that as the case may require consideration of the correctness of the view taken by a Full Bench of Patna High Court in Raj Kumar Prasad v. Uchit Narain Singh MANU/BH/0056/1980MANU/BH/0056/1980 : AIR1980Pat242 in view two decisions of this Court in Gowali Charan v. Surendra Kumar Khandani and Ors. MANU/SC/0758/1987MANU/SC/0758/1987 : JT1987(1)SC625 and Satyanarain Kandu v. Smt. Hemlata and Ors. 1996 PLR 110 SC both by two-Judge Bench and as such has referred the matter to a Bench of three Ld. Judges. It is in this way, this matter has come up before us. Learned Counsel for the appellant urged that view taken by the High Court is in conflict with the two decisions of this Court and therefore the Judgment under challenge deserved to be set aside. We do not find any merit in the argument for the reasons stated hereinafter.

3. Second 11(1)(d) of the Bihar Buildings (Lease, Rent & Eviction) Control Act reads thus:

""11. Eviction of tenants - (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in my contract or law to the contrary but subject to the provisions of the Industrial disputes Act, 1947 (Act XIV of 1947), and to those Section 18, where a tenant is in possession of any building, he shall not be liable to eviction therefrom except in execution of a decree passed by the Court on one or more of the following grounds:

(a) ...

(b) ...

(c) ...

(d) Where the amount of two months rents, lawfully payable by the tenant and due from him is in arrears by not having been paid within the time fixed by contract, or in the absence of such contract, by the last day of the month next following that for which the rent is payable or by not having been validly remitted or deposited in accordance with Section 16.""

4. The provisions of the said Act would clearly show that unlike Rent Control Statutes of other States, the expression 'wilful default' or 'habitual default' has not been used therein. The words are 'is in arrears'. In the event, rent for two months is not paid a cause of action arises. The statute mandates that the rent should be paid within the time fixed by the contract and in absence thereof by the last date of the month next following. The obligation on the part of the tenant to pay rent in the manner laid down under the Act, being a statutory one, he must comply therewith strictly. The statute, therefore, in other words, prescribes the period within which the rent must be rendered to the landlord by a tenant. When the statute lays down the period during which the rent is required to be paid or deposited, the same is required to be complied with.

5. Recently, in E. Palanisamy v. Palanisamy (dead) by Lrs. and Ors. MANU/SC/0967/2002MANU/SC/0967/2002 : AIR2003SC153 , a Division Bench of this Court observed:

""....The rent legislation is normally intended for the benefit of the tenants. At the same time, it is well settled that the benefit conferred on the tenants through the relevant statutes can be enjoyed only on the basis of strict compliance with the statutory provisions. Equitable consideration has no place in such matters...""

6. It is also pertinent to note that the Rent Control Act is not only a beneficial enactment for the tenant but also for the benefit of the landlord. (See Shri Lakshmi Venkateshwara Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. v. Syeda Vajuninissa Begum (Smt.) and Ors. MANU/SC/0668/1994MANU/SC/0668/1994 : (1994)2SCC671 ).

7. Yet there a another aspect of the matter which cannot be lost sight of. It is a well settled principle that if a thing is required to be by a private person within a specified time, the same would ordinarily be mandatory but when a public functionary is required to perform a public function within a time-frame, the same will be held to be directory unless the consequences therefore are specified. In Sutherland, Statutory Construction, 3rd edition, Vol. 3 at p. 107, it is pointed out that a statutory direction to private individuals should generally be considered as mandatory and that the rule is just the opposite to that which obtains with respect to public officers. Again, at p. 109, it is pointed out that often the question as to whether a mandatory or directory construction should be given to a statutory provision may be determined by an expression in the statute itself of be result that shall follow non-compliance with the provision. At page 111 it is stated as follows:

""As a corollary of the rule outlined above, the fact that no consequences of non-compliance are stated in the statute, has been considered as a factor tending towards a directory construction. But this is only an element to be considered, and is by no means conclusive.""

8. It is in the aforementioned backdrop the decisions of this Court relied upon by Mr. Upadhyay are required to be considered.

9. In Gowli Charan v. Surendra Kumar Khandani and Ors. MANU/SC/0758/1987MANU/SC/0758/1987, this Court did not lay down any law within the meaning of Article 141 of the Constitution of India. The judgment does not contain any reason. It does not set out any fact nor did it take notice of any precedent. It is difficult to ascertain as to on what grounds this Court observed:

""Having regard to the fact that the entire rent for the period in question from January-February, 1967 to January-February, 1968 had been paid to the plaintiff, we do not think that the High Court was justified in holding that the plea of wilful default has been established entitling the plaintiff to a decree for eviction under Section 11(1)(c) of the Bihar Building (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1982.""

10. This decision in our opinion does not lay down the correct law and must be over-ruled.

11. In Satyanarain Kandu v. Smt. Hemlata and Ors. (996 PLR 110 SC, this Court passed an order presumably in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 142 of Constitution of India. In that case, it was categorically held that the default had taken place but the same was held to be merely a technical one. If a cause of action arose for the landlord to file a suit for eviction against the tenant, such a cause of action cannot be held to be non-existent only because, in the opinion of this Court, the default was technical one. The said decision also does not lay down the correct view of the law and must be over-ruled.

12. We, therefore, are of the opinion that the High Court has rightly held that by reason of the said two decisions the Full Bench decision of the High Court cannot be said to have been over-ruled.

13. In C.A. No. 5077/1998, which we have decided today, we have held that where a statute empowers the Court to extend time or further time when a tenant fails to deposit rent within the stipulated time, only in such cases, the Court possesses power to extend time and in no other cases.

14. For aforesaid reasons, the appeal is dismissed. However, there shall be no order as to costs.

V.N. Khare, C.J.

1. Leave granted.

2. The appellant's son, aged 24 years and drawing a sum of Rs. 4,000/- per month, died in a motor vehicle accident. The appellant herein filed a claim petition before the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as 'the Tribunal'). The Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs. 3,50,000/- as compensation. Aggrieved, the insurer, who is respondent No. 1 herein, filed a writ petition under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India before the Guwahati High Court. A learned Single Judge of the High Court dismissed the writ petition. Aggrieved, the insurer preferred a Letters Patent Appeal before the Division Bench of the High Court. Before the High Court, the claimant took an objection that since petition under Article 226/227 is not maintainable, therefore, the appeal is totally misconceived and the same deserves dismissal on that ground alone. However, the Division Bench of the High Court, after overruling the objection allowed the appeal preferred by the insurer and reduced the compensation from Rs. 3,50,000/- to Rs. 3.00,000/-. It is against the said judgment, the present appeal has been filed by way of special leave petition.

3. Learned counsel appearing for the appellant urged that in view of the fact that under Section 173 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act'), a remedy by way of appeal to the High Court is available to the insurer against an award given by the Tribunal, and, therefore, the filing of a petition under Article 227 of the Constitution was misconceived and deserved dismissal and the High Court ought not to have entertained and decided the writ petition on merits. We find merit in the submission.

4. It is not disputed that under Section 173 of the Act, an insurer has right to file an appeal before the High Court on limited grounds available under Section 149(2) of the Act. However, in a situation where there is a collusion between the claimant and the insured or the insured does not contest the claim and further if the Tribunal does not implead the insurance company to contest the claim, in such a situation it is open to an insurer to seek permission of the Tribunal to contest the claim on the ground available to the insured or to a person against whom a claim has been made. If permission is granted and the insurer is allowed to contest the claim on merit, in that case it is open to the insurer to file an appeal against the award of the Tribunal on merits. Thus, in such a situation, the insurer can question the quantum of compensation awarded by the Tribunal.

5. However, learned counsel for the respondent argued that since an insurer has limited grounds available under Section 173 of the Act, it is open to an insurer to file a petition under Article 226/227 of the Constitution. The right of appeal is a statutory right and where the law provides remedy by filing an appeal on limited grounds, the grounds of challenge cannot be enlarged by filing a petition under Article 226/227 of the Constitution on the premise that the insurer has limited grounds available for challenging the award given by the Tribunal. Section 149(2) of the Act limits the insurer to file an appeal on those enumerated grounds and the appeal being a product of the statute it is not open to an insurer to take any plea other than those provided under Section 149(2) of the Act (see National Insurance Co. Ltd, Chandigarh vs. Nicolletta Rohtagi and others). This being the legal position, the petition filed under Article 227 of the Constitution by the insurer was wholly misconceived. Where a statutory right to file an appeal has been provided for, it is not open to High Court to entertain a petition under Article 227 of the Constitution. Even if where a remedy by way of an appeal has not been provided for against the order and judgment of a District Judge, the remedy available to the aggrieved person is to file a revision before the High Court under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Where remedy for filing a revision before the High Court under Section 115 of CPC has been expressly barred by a State enactment, only in such case a petition under Article 227 of the Constitution would lie and not under Article 226 of the Constitution. As a matter of an illustration, where a trial Court in a civil suit refused to grant temporary injunction and an appeal against refusal to grant injunction has been rejected, and a State enactment has barred the remedy of filing revision under Section 115 C.P.C., in such a situation a writ petition under Article 227 would lie and not under Article 226 of the Constitution. Thus, where the State legislature has barred a remedy of filing a revision petition before the High Court under Section 115 C.P.C., no petition under Article 226 of the Constitution would lie for the reason that a mere wrong decision without anything more is not enough to attract jurisdiction of High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution.

6. The supervisory jurisdiction conferred on the High Courts under Article 227 of the Constitution is confined only to see whether an inferior court or Tribunal has proceeded within its parameters and not to correct an error apparent on the face of the record, much less of an error of law. In exercising the supervisory power under Article 227 of the Constitution, the High Court does not act as an Appellate Court or the Tribunal. It is also not permissible to a High Court on a petition filed under Article 227 of the Constitution to review or re-weigh the evidence upon which the inferior court or Tribunal purports to have passed the order or to correct errors of law in the decision.

7. For the aforesaid reasons, we are of the view that since the insurer has a remedy by filling an appeal before the High Court, the High Court ought not to have entertained the petition under Article 226/227 of the Constitution and for that reason, the judgment and order under challenge deserves to be set aside. We, accordingly, set aside the judgment and order under appeal. The appeal is allowed. There shall be no order as to costs. However, it would be open to the insurer to file an appeal if it is permissible under the law.

1. We have heard Shri Shambu Prasad Singh advocate for the appellant. The respondent no. 1 who was the writ petitioner before the High Court has not appeared despite service of notice.

2. The respondent No. 1 had purchased the truck bearing No. ORY-2785 utilising' the loan taken from the Orissa State Financial Corporation the appellant herein. As he defaulted in depositing the installments fixed under the agreement, the corporation seized the vehicle exercising its power under Sections 29 and 30 of the State Financial Corporation Act. The respondent filed the writ petition registered as OJC No. 201 of 1991 assailing the notice issued under section 30 of the Act and for quashing the notice for auction of the seized vehicle, etc. In the said proceeding, the High Court passed an interim order on 14.1.1991 which reads as under:

""Heard the petitioner in person. It is stated by the petitioner, who appears before us, that the sale of the truck bearing registration number ORY 2785 is fixed for tomorrow. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, we direct stay of confirmation of sale, if sale is held. The petitioner shall deposit Rs. 25,0007- (Rupees twenty five thousand) with the corporation by tomorrow. The matter shall be taken up for further orders on Tuesday (22.1.1991).""

3. The respondent failed to deposit the sum of Rs. 25,000/- as ordered by the High Court. The corporation went ahead with auction as scheduled and the vehicle was sold to one Shri Navkishore Bhutan for a sum of Rs. 2,20,0007-. The sale was confirmed on 28.1.1991, The writ petitioner again approached the High Court for an interim order for releasing the vehicles. By the order dated 8.2.1991, the High Court issued the following directions;

""The opposite parties are directed to show cause as to why they shall not be suitably punished for having deliberately flouted the court's order by putting the vehicle into auction sale notwithstanding the interim order of this court. They should also show cause as to why they refuse to accept the money that was offered by the petitioner pursuant to the order of this court dated 14.1 1991. Along with the show cause, the opposite party No.2 should appear in person in the court on 27.2.1991. In the meantime, the opposite parties are restrained from taking any further action for transfer of ownership of the vehicle in question.""

4. This was followed by another interim order passed on 27th February 1991 in which the court directed the corporation to hand over possession of the vehicle to the writ petitioner by recovering the same from the auction purchaser within one month and further directed that on possession of the vehicle being so handed over, the writ petitioner shall pay a sum of Rs.12,0007- per month and on failure to do so, the entire amount shall become realizable in accordance with law.

5. The writ petitioner filed misc. case No. 109/91 complaining before the Court that the corporation and its officers have failed to carry out the directions of the High Court and possession of the vehicle has not been delivered to him. On the said application, the High Court by the order dated 9.7.1991 granted further one month's time to take over the vehicle from the possession of the auction purchaser, Naba Kishore Bhutan and permitted the corporation to seek police help from the Jagatsinghpur police station. Finally, the Court disposed of the writ petition, OJC No. 201/91 and the contempt petition, original criminal misc. case No. 109/91 by the order passed on 30th January, 1992. The relevant portion of the said order reads as follows:

""The petitioner shall file a fresh application before the corporation to advance loan to purchase a new truck and, on this being done, the corporation shall sanction the loan within two month after the petitioner complies with the necessary formalities. Though in this connection, it has been urged by Shri Patnaik appearing for the corporation that as the price fetched in the auction was about Rs. 2,20,000/- as against the defaulted amount of Rs. 2,36,525/- as on 31.12.1990 the corporation should be allowed to realize the balance amount from the petitioner in accordance with law, on the facts of this case, we have not felt inclined to accept this submission because the sale In the present case was on 28.1.1991. Therefore, according to us, it is a fit case where the remaining amount of about Rs. 16,5007- should be written off by the corporation.

As to the purchaser in the auction, we would say that he would file appropriate representation before the corporation for waiving of the interest till date whereupon, the corporation shall take such decision as deemed fit and proper. The order of the seizure passed on 27.2.1991 in OJC No. 201/91 stands vacated.""

6. The said order is under challenge in this appeal. On a plain reading of the impugned order it is manifest that the High Court, while considering the writ petition filed by the owner of the vehicle for quashing of the notice of auction sale and for other consequential reliefs, has passed order drawing up a fresh contract between the parties and has issued certain further directions in the matter; the corporation has been directed to advance a fresh loan to the writ petitioner to enable him to purchase a new truck; to enter into agreement for realization of the balance loan amount in accordance with law; to write off the remaining amount of Rs. 16,500/-and to order waiving of the interest till date etc. The order to say the least, was beyond the scope of the writ petition which was being considered by the High Court and beyond the jurisdiction of the court in a contractual matter. No doubt, while exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court has wide power to pass appropriate order and issue proper direction as necessary in the facts and circumstances of the case and in the interest of justice. But that is not to say that the High Court can ignore the scope of the writ petition and nature of the dispute and enter the field pertaining to contractual obligations between the parties and issue such directions annulling the existing contract and introducing a fresh contract in its place.

7. The prevailing factual position as on date, as stated by the learned counsel for the appellants, is that in compliance with the interim order of stay passed by this Court, no further step has been taken and the possession of the vehicle has remained with the auction purchaser. The corporation has realized certain amount from the auction purchaser towards its dues and the balance amount is yet to be realized. It also appears that the respondent No. 1 who was the owner of the seized vehicle has lost interest in the matter, in all probability due to the lapse of about more than 12 years in the meantime.

8. On facts and in the circumstances of the case, the orders passed by the High Court are clearly unsustainable and are to be set aside. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the orders of the High Court which are under challenge are set aside.

S.L.P. (C) No. 12578/1992

1. Leave granted.

2. These appeals by special leave are directed against the judgment and order dated January 16, 2002 of High Court of Madhya Pradesh, by which three Petitions filed by the appellants under Section 482 Cr.P.C. were dismissed.

3. M/s. Cadbury Schweppes Beverages India Private Ltd. entered into three identical Bottling Agreements with the complainant, Sanjiva Bottling Company Private Limited on March 1, 1996 pursuant to a Master Trademark License entered into by associate companies of Cadbury Schweppes plc. United Kingdom and Cadbury Schweppes Beverages India Private Limited. In terms of these three agreements, M/s. Sanjiva Bottling Company was authorised to manufacture and sell certain specified beverages under specified trademarks owned by Cadbury Schweppes plc. U.K. or its associate companies. The agreements contained identical clauses with regard to their respective terms and conditions and provided that they shall continue for initial term of five years and for further successive period of five years, unless terminated by either party by giving to the other not less than 12 calendar months notice in writing to terminate the agreement. On July 29, 1999, Atlantic Industries (a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Export Corporation, USA) purchased about 3500 trademark in 155 countries from Cadbury Schweppes plc., upon which the bottling agreements between Cadbury Schweppes Beverages India Pvt. Ltd. and Sanjiva Bottling Company were duly assigned to Atlantic Industries and an information regarding the same was given to Sanjiva Bottling Company is writing. On February 14, 2000, Atlantic Industries gave notice in writing to the complainant, Sanjiva Bottling Company that the bottling agreements shall not be renewed after their expiry on February 28, 2001.

4. Sanjiva Bottling Company through its Director, Rajiv Mehta filed a criminal complaint against 11 accused including the appellants in the Court of Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Bhopal on July 24, 2000 for their prosecution under Section 420 read with Section 511 IPC. The accused No. 1 arrayed in the complaint is Cadbury Schweppes Beverages India Pvt. Ltd. (A-1) and accused Nos. 2 to 5 are Chairman, Managing Director and Finance Director etc. of the said Company. Besides them, Coca Cola India (A-6), Alex Von Behr, President and Chief Executive Officer (A-7). Nitin Dalvi, Vice-President, Strategic Business, Planning and Information Service (A-8) and Samip Shah, Vice-President, Business Development of Coca Cola India, (A-8) Ajay Mitra, Regional Operational Director, Hindustan Coca Cola Beverages Pvt. Ltd. (A-10) and Steve M. Whaley, Vice-President and General Tax Counsel, Atlantic Industries (A-11) have been arrayed as accused Nos. 6 to 11. The case set up in the complaint is that the complainant is engaged in the business of bottling soft drink since 1983 at Bhopal. The complainant was approached by A-1 in 1995 to discontinue its competing brand 'Sprint' and Memorandum of Understanding was signed on October 9, 1995. Thereafter, an agreement was entered into between the complainant and A-1 on March 1, 1996 by which the complainant became one of the bottlers of A-1, made investments in the bottling plant and also promoted the sales of A-1 in its area. By a letter dated July 29, 1999, A-1 informed the complainant that the brands Schweppes, Crush and Canada Dry and associated brands in India would be acquired by a member of the Coca Cola group of companies. A-1 had 19 bottlers in the year 1997 but Coca Cola India (A-6) had reduced them to 7 and is installing its own bottling plants in different places. The case of the complainant further is that by the letter dated February 14, 2000, A-6 informed the complainant that they would not renew the agreements on their expiry on February 28, 2001. In paras 47 and 48 of the complaint, it is alleged that A-6 is adopting all sorts of unfair trade practices and that it has made wrongful gain of over Rs. 100 crores. In para 50, it is alleged that A-1 and A-6 have not replied properly to the letters of the complainant and the accused have, therefore, cheated the complainant by making false representation.

5. The learned Magistrate before whom the complaint was filed passed an order under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. on July 27, 2000 directing the police to investigate the offence as the same was cognizable offence. The police thereafter submitted a report on October 31, 2000 which reads as under:

""After the entire inquiry it appears that the Cadbury Schweppes Company and Coca Cola Company have violated the terms and conditions of Business Agreement, as a result, the complainant has suffered financial loss. The complainant was kept in darkness and supplied confusing information, consequently, Complainant suffered economic loss. Prima facie a case of business competition and violation of Agreements is made out and the complainant is advised to approach the civil Court.""

6. After consideration of the report the learned Magistrate was of the opinion that the police had not submitted the same in accordance with Section 173(2) Cr.P.C. and also in the proforma prescribed in the Rules framed by the State Government as the same had been submitted on plain paper. The SHO, PS Govindpura was accordingly directed on November 16, 2000 to submit a report in the prescribed proforma.

7. On January 11, 2001, the Police submitted a report that on the basis of the complaint, Case Crime No. 5 of 2001, Case Crime No. 13 of 2001 and Case Crime No. 18 of 2001 has been registered under Section 420, 120-B, 34 IPC. On the same date, the learned Magistrate passed an order that the Police had registered the offence and investigation is being carried on and, therefore, the complainant should make available Hindi translation of the documents and fixed January 30, 2001 as the next date. Thereafter, the appellants filed three Criminal Miscellaneous Petitions under Section 482 Cr.P.C. before the High Court for quashing of the FIR and the proceedings of the case before the learned Magistrate. After hearing the parties, the High Court held that the investigation had not yet commenced in connection with the FIRs which had been registered at the Police Station and, therefore, the Petitions were pre-mature and accordingly all the three Petitions were rejected.

8. Shri F.S. Nariman, learned senior counsel for the appellants has submitted that M/s Cadbury Schweppes Beverages India Pvt. Ltd. (A-1) had entered into bottling agreements with the complainant Sanjiva Bottling Company on March 1, 1996 and the said agreements were to continue for a term of five years. It also contained a clause that either party could terminate the agreement at the end of initial term by giving to the other side not less than 12 calender months notice in writing. Subsequent to the execution of the agreement, Atlantic Industries (a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Export Corporation, USA) purchased the trademarks from Cadbury Schweppes plc. on July 29, 1999, upon which the bottling agreements between the complainant, Sanjiva Bottling Company were duly assigned to Atlantic Industries and information regarding the same was also given to the complainant. Atlantic Industries thereafter gave notice to the complainant on February 14, 2000 not to renew the bottling agreements which were to expire on February 28, 2001 and the agreements with the complainant came to end on the said date. The leaned counsel has further submitted that there is absolutely no allegation in the complaint that the appellants (A-7 to A-11) had at any time made any kind of mis-representation to the complainant or had asked it to do or omit to do anything and as such no offence under Section 420 IPC is made out against them. It has thus been urged that the allegations made in the complaint, even if accepted at their face value, do not disclose commission of any offence by the appellants and, therefore, the proceedings of the complaint case and also the FIRs lodged against the appellants are liable to be quashed.

9. The learned Advocate General for the State of Madhya Pradesh has submitted that as per the order of the learned Magistrate dated July 27, 2000, the Police had submitted a report that prima facie it was a case of violation of agreement for which the complainant could seek relief from the civil Court. However, in view of subsequent order passed by the learned Magistrate on November 16, 2000 a case had been registered at the Police Station and the matter was being investigated.

10. Shri Sushil Kumar, learned senior counsel for the complainant has submitted that the allegations made in the complaint disclose commission of an offence under Section 420 IPC by the accused persons and a case has been registered at the Police Station and investigation is being carried out. Learned counsel has further submitted that the High Court rightly took the view that the Petitions filed by the appellants for quashing of the proceedings were pre-mature and the said order does not suffer from any error of law.

11. We have given our careful consideration to the submissions made by learned counsel for the parties. It may be stated at the very outset that the main allegation made in the complaint is against M/s. Cadbury Schweppes Beverages India Pvt. Ltd. (A-1). It is stated in para 5 of the complaint that the Technical Directors of A-1 approached the complainant and a Memorandum of Understanding was signed on October 9, 1995 and the complainant was asked to discontinue competing brand 'Sprint' within six months of the introduction of 'Canada Dry' and it was also asked to carry out certain jobs at its bottling plant. The complainant thereafter modernised its bottling plant as per the requirement and satisfaction of A-1. Thereafter, the bottling agreements were executed between the complainant and A-1 on March 1, 1996. Coca Cola India (A-6) came into picture for the first time when Atlantic Industries (a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Export Corporation, USA) purchased 3500 trademarks in 155 countries from Cadbury Schweppes plc. on July 29, 1999, upon which the bottling agreements between A-1 and the complainant was assigned to Atlantic Industries. A-1 also informed the complainant in writing on July 29, 1999 that the brands Schweppes, Crush and Canada Dry and associated brands in India will be acquired by a Member of the Coca Cola Group of Companies and the bottling agreements will be assigned to Atlantic Industries. Clause 19 of the Agreement which was executed between the complainant and A-1 on March 1, 1996 reads as under:-

""This Agreement shall come into operation on the Effective Date and subject to the terms herein contained shall continue for a term of 5 (five) years therefrom (the ""Initial Term"") and thereafter provided that the Company has complied with the conditions set out below shall continue in force for further successive periods of 5 (five) years unless and until terminated by either party giving to the other not less than twelve calendar months notice in writing to terminate the same expiring at the end of the Initial Term or any such subsequent period, the said conditions being:

(i) that the Company has complied with its obligation during (as the case may be) the Initial Term or the relevant subsequent period (including without limitation its obligations pursuant to Sub-clause 7.1) and

(ii) prior agreement of the parties in writing on the Base Plan to come into effect at the start of such subsequent period and as to the levels of Annual Minimum Aggregate Sales which shall apply during such subsequent period.""

12. Thereafter on February 14, 2000 a notice was given jointly by Atlantic Industries, Canada Dry Corporation Limited and Cadbury Schweppes Beverages Ltd. to the complainant, Sanjiva Bottling Company and it reads as under:

""We refer to Agreements (to include any addenda entered into subsequently) entered into between yourselves (""the Company"") in relation to the production, sale and distribution of ""Crush"", ""Canada Dry"", ""Schweppes"", and ""Sport Cola"" Products with an Effective Date of 01 March 1996 (""called the Agreement""). All defined terms used in the Agreement shall have the same meaning prescribed in this letter, save as expressly stated otherwise.

Please take this letter as the required 12 months notice, pursuant to Clause 19 of our intention not to renew this Agreement on expiry on 28 February 2001 (""the Expiry Date""). We would however, require that you continue to fully carry out all obligations under the terms of your Agreement until the Expiry Date.""

13. The agreements executed between the complainant and A-1 on March 1, 1996 were for a period of five years. Though the same could continue for a further successive period of five years, but either party to the agreement had a right to terminate the same expiring at the end of the initial term by giving not less than 12 calendar (SIC) notice in writing. The initial period of five years would have come to an end on February 28, 2001 but on February 14, 2000, notice was given to the complainant that the said agreements would not be renewed after expiry of the initial period i.e. after February 28, 2001. Even when the agreements were executed in March, 1996, the complainant was fully aware that the same may not be renewed further after expiry of the initial term of five years.

14. According to the allegations made in the complaint, it was the Technical Directors of A-1 who had approached the complainant and a Memorandum of Understanding was signed on October 9, 1995. The modernisation of the bottling plant was done by the complainant as per the requirement and satisfaction of A-1 and thereafter the agreements were executed between them (Complainant and A-1) on March 1, 1996 in pursuance whereof the complainant claims to have spent considerable amount of money in improvement of the bottling plant. There is no allegation (SIC) complaint that A-6 to A-11 or anyone on their behalf ever met the complainant or asked it to invest any money or to do anything for improvement of the bottling plant. In fact there is absolutely no reference to A-6 to A-11 in the complaint except that A-6 is installing its own bottling plants and that A-6 gave notice to the complainant not to renew the agreements after expiry of the initial term. In paras 33 and 34 of the complaint, the entire allegations are made against A-1 and it is said that A-1 was actuated by dishonest intention to cheat the complainant and that A-1 has committed the offence of cheating. In para 47 of the complaint it has been alleged that A-6 is adopting all sorts of unfair trade practices.

15. Section 420 IPC says that ""Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person deceived to deliver any property to any person.....shall be punished with imprisonment....."" Cheating has been defined in Section 415 IPC and it says that ""Whoever, by deceiving any person, fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver any property to any person, of the consent that any person shall retain any property, or intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived, and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind, reputation or property, is said to ""cheat"".""

16. A guilty intention is an essential ingredient of the offence of cheating. In other words 'mens rea' on the part of the accused must be established before he can be convicted of an offence of cheating. (See Jeswantrai Manilal Akhaney v. The State of Bombay-- MANU/SC/0030/1956MANU/SC/0030/1956 : 1956CriLJ1116 ). In Mahadeo Prasad v. State of West Bengal MANU/SC/0181/1954MANU/SC/0181/1954 : AIR1954SC724 , it was held as follows:

""Where the charge against the accused is under Section 420 in that he induced the complainant to part with his goods, on the understanding that the accused would pay for the same on delivery but did not pay, if the accused had at the time he promised to pay cash against delivery an intention to do so, the fact that he did not pay would not convert the transaction into one of cheating. But if on the other hand he had no intention whatsoever to pay but merely said that he would do so in order to induce the complaint to part with the goods then a case of cheating would be established.""

17. In Hari Prasad Chamaria v. Bishun Kumar Surekha and Ors. MANU/SC/0112/1973MANU/SC/0112/1973 : 1974CriLJ352 it was held that unless the complaint showed that the accused had dishonest or fraudulent intention at the time the complainant parted with the money it would not amount to an offence under Section 420 IPC and it may only amount to breach of contract. In G.V. Rao v. L.H.V. Prasad and Ors. : 2000CriLJ3487 , it was reiterated that guilty intention is an essential ingredient of the offence of cheating and, therefore, to secure conviction 'mens rea' on the part of the accused must be established. It has been further held that in order to constitute the offence of cheating the intention to deceive should be in existence at the time when the inducement was offered.

18. So far as the present appellants are concerned, they came into picture much later in July 1999, when various trademarks and brands of A- were purchased by A-6. The appellants were not at all in picture at the time when the complainant claims to have spent money in improvement of its bottling plant on the basis of the agreement executed with Cadbury Schweppes Beverages India Pvt. Ltd. (A-1). Since the appellants were not in picture at all at the time when the complainant alleges to have spent money in improving the bottling plant, neither any guilty intention can be attributed to them nor there can possibly be any intention on their part to deceive the complainant. No offence of cheating can, therefore, be said to have been committed by the appellants on account of the fact that a notice was given to the complainant that the bottling agreements will not be renewed any further after expiry of the initial term. Thus, even if the allegations made in the complaint are accepted to be absolutely true and correct, the appellants cannot be said to have committed any offence of cheating as provided in Section 420 IPC.

19. The High Court has held that the Petitions filed by the appellants for quashing the complaint and the FIRs registered against them are pre-mature. The question which arises is that where the complaint or the FIR does not disclose commission of a cognizable offence, whether the same can be quashed at the initial stage? This question was examined by this Court in State of West Bengal and Ors. v Swapan Kumar Guha and Ors. MANU/SC/0120/1982MANU/SC/0120/1982 : 1982CriLJ819 and it was held that the First Information Report which does not allege or disclose that the essential requirements of the penal provision are prima facie satisfied, cannot form the foundation or constitute the starting point of a lawful investigation. It is surely not within the province of the police to investigate into a Report (FIR) which does not disclose the commission of a cognizable offence and the Code does not impose upon them the duty of inquiry in such cases. It was further held that an investigation can be quashed if not cognizable offence is disclosed by the FIR. The same question has been considered in State of Haryana and Ors. v. Ch. Bhajan Lal and Ors. MANU/SC/0115/1992MANU/SC/0115/1992 : 1992CriLJ527 and after considering all the earlier decisions, the category of cases, in which the Court can exercise its extra-ordinary power under Article 226 of the Constitution or the inherent power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. either to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or to secure the ends of justice, were summarised in para 108 of the Report and sub-paras 1 to 3 thereof are being reproduced hereinbelow:

""1. Where the allegations made in the First Information Report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused.

2. Where the allegations in the First Information Report and other materials, if any, accompanying the F.I.R. do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investigation by police officers under Section 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.

3. Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against the accused.""

20. As mentioned earlier, the allegations made in the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety, do not constitute any offence as against the appellants. therefore, the complaint filed by the respondent and the FIRs registered in pursuance thereof are liable to be quashed. Trisuns Chemical Industry v. Rajesh Agarwal and Ors. MANU/SC/0581/1999MANU/SC/0581/1999 : 1999CriLJ4325 cited by learned counsel for the complainant is clearly distinguishable as in the said case the allegation in the complaint was that the complainant had paid in advance a price higher than the market price for purchasing ""toasted soyabean extracts"" but the accused sent the commodity which was of most inferior and substandard quality due to which the complainant suffered a loss of Rs. 17 lakhs. In view of the allegations made in the complaint, the matter required investigation and the proceedings could not have been quashed on the ground that the dispute was of a civil nature.

21. In the result, the appeals are allowed. The impugned judgment and order dated January 16, 2002 of the High Court is set aside and the complaint filed by the Respondent No. 2 and the FIRs registered in pursuance thereof as Case Crime Nos. 5 of 2001, 13 of 2001 and 18 of 2001, as against the appellants, are quashed.

"

1. These two appeals are directed against the judgment of a learned single judge of the Allahabad High Court, Lucknow bench, by grant of certificate from the said judgment. The two appeals are filed by the ceiling surplus tenure holder and his wife and one of the dispute was whether there has been a divorce between them as early as in the year 1969.

2. After coming into force of the U.P. Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings Act, 1960 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') before the prescribed authority, the tenure holder took a stand that the land recorded in the name of his wife who has already been divorced since 1969 cannot be clubbed. The wife also took a similar stand. Section 3(7) of the Act defines the expression 'family' in relation to a tenure holder to mean himself or herself and his wife or her husband as the case may be, (other than a judicially separated wife or husband), minor sons and minor daughters (other than married daughters). Since the prescribed authority was required to determine the ceiling surplus in the hand of the tenure holder, one of the questions for consideration was whether in fact there has been a divorce between the tenure holder and his wife as claimed by them or it was merely a subterfuge to get over the rigours of the provisions of the Ceiling Act. On the basis of materials produced before it, the prescribed authority came to the conclusion that in fact there had been no divorce and the parties adopted divorce attempts for escaping the ceiling law. The said prescribed authority also came to the conclusion that there was no other document excepting the family register kept with the pradhan, where the wife and the husband have been entered separately. In fact the prescribed authority gave due weight to the family register which had been kept with the rural development officer who was the competent authority to issue the family register. Having come to the aforesaid conclusion, the prescribed authority concluded that the land standing in the name of Khatoon Nisa, wife of Rahmatullah, the tenure holder, has to be clubbed with the holding of the tenure holder, inasmuch as they come within the definition of the 'family' under Section 3 (7) of the Act.

3. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid order of the prescribed authority, both Sh. Rahmatullah and his wife, Smt. Khatoon Nisa, preferred appeals under Section 13 of the Act and the appellate authority affirmed the conclusion arrived at by the prescribed authority and came to the conclusion that there has been no error committed by the prescribed authority in treating the appellant being members of the same family for the purpose of the provisions of the Act. The two appeals thus having been dismissed, the matter was carried to the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution. The learned judge of the High Court, without being guided by the parameters for exercise of power under Article 226 against an order of an inferior tribunal, went on to examine the issue as to whether there can be a divorce under the Muslim law by uttering three times the word 'talaq' in one sitting and having elaborately delved into the same came to the conclusion that such 'talaq' is unconstitutional and cannot be sustained. Having thus came to the aforesaid conclusion, the court affirmed the conclusion of the prescribed authority under the Ceiling Act in the matter of determination of the surplus land in the hands of the tenure holder. The court having granted certificate against the judgment the appeals came to be filed.

4. Dr. Dhawan learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants, contended that the High Court while exercising its power of supervisory jurisdiction of a writ of certiorari is called upon to examine the correctness of the conclusion arrived at by the inferior tribunal and will be justified in interfering with those conclusions if the inferior tribunal either has admitted inadmissible evidence under consideration or has rejected any admissible piece of material or that the conclusion is such which cannot be said to be a reasonable one on the materials on record or that the finding is based on no evidence. These being the parameters for exercise of the power, the High Court should have limited its consideration only to the materials on which the prescribed authority and appellate authority under the Act came to the conclusion and the High Court was not called upon to examine the larger issue about the constitutionality and legality of a divorce made by a Muslim male by uttering talaq three times at one sitting. Dr. Dhawan also urged that the conclusion of the prescribed authority as well as that of the appellate authority cannot be sustained in law since the judgment is not based on the relevant materials. So far as the first submission of Dr. Dhawan is concerned, we find force in the same as in our opinion in the writ petition filed by the tenure holder and his wife, it was not necessary for the court to examine a larger issue on the question of the constitutionality and validity of a divorce by a Muslim man by uttering 'talaq' thrice in one sitting. We, therefore, do not intend to delve into that question and in our opinion the aforesaid conclusion of the High Court was not required to be gone into in the case in hand and the said conclusion would not operate as law of the land until and unless the same arises in an appropriate case and decided accordingly. So far as the second contention of Dr. Dhawan is concerned we, however, do not agree with the same and after perusing the order of the prescribed authority as well as that of the appellate authority, we do not find any error of law much less any error apparent on the face of the order which required to be corrected by issuance of a writ of certiorari. The materials on the basis of which the conclusion of the prescribed authority as well as that of the appellate authority was based cannot be said to be on irrelevant materials nor the ultimate conclusion can be said to be one without any evidence for the same. In that view of the matter the ultimate determination of the ceiling land in the hand of the surplus holder does not require any interference by the Court. These appeals are, therefore, disposed of accordingly.

5. All applications filed in these matters also stand disposed of.

In Crl. A. No. 699/1993

6. This appeal stands disposed of in terms of our judgment delivered today in crl. appeal Nos. 213-216/1996.

In WP(C) No. 792/1994

7. This writ petition was filed as a counterblast to criminal appeals nos. 213-216/1996 which have already been disposed of by us today.

8. After going through the prayer of the writ petition and on examining the averments made in the writ petition, we find that there is no material on the basis of which the Court is in a position to grant any appropriate relief. This writ petition accordingly stands dismissed.

In Crl. A. Nos. 213-216/96 and 569/95

9. These appeals raise the question, as to whether a magistrate is entitled to invoke his jurisdiction under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr. P.C.) to grant maintenance in favour of divorced Muslim women.

10. Subsequent to the enactment of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 (for short ""the Act"") as it was considered that the jurisdiction of the magistrate under Section 125 Cr. P.C. can be invoked only when the condition precedent mentioned in Section 5 of the Act are complied with, in the case in hand, the magistrate came to a finding that there has been no divorce in the eye of law and as such, the magistrate has the jurisdiction to grant maintenance under Section 125 of the Cr. P.C. This finding of the magistrate has been upheld by the High Court. The validity of the provisions of the Act was for consideration before the constitution bench in the case of Danial Latifi and Anr. v. Union of India. In the said case by reading down the provisions of the Act, the validity of the Act has been upheld and it has been observed that under the Act itself when parties agree, the provisions of Section 125 Cr. P.C. could be invoked as contained in Section 5 of the Act and even otherwise, the magistrate under the Act has the power to grant maintenance in favour of a divorced woman, and the parameters and considerations are the same as those in Section 125 Cr. P.C.. It is undoubtedly true that in the case in hand, Section 5 of the Act has not been invoked. Necessarily, therefore, the magistrate has exercised his jurisdiction under Section 125 Cr. P.C. But, since the magistrate retains the power of granting maintenance in view of the constitution bench decision in Danial Latifi's case (supra) under the Act and since the parameters for exercise of that power are the same as those contained in Section 125 Cr. P.C., we see no ground to interfere with the orders of the magistrate granting maintenance in favour of a divorced Muslim woman. In fact, Mr. Qamaruddin, learned counsel appearing for the appellants, never objected to pay maintenance as ordered by the magistrate. But he seriously disputes the findings of the magistrate on the status of the parties and contends that the magistrate was wholly in error in coming to the conclusion that there has been no divorce between the parties in the eye of law.

11. In view of our aforesaid conclusion, it is not necessary for us to examine the correctness of the finding on the status of the parties, inasmuch as that finding was merely for the purpose of exercising jurisdiction under Section 125 Cr. P.C. and has no bearing at all in deciding the status of the parties.

12. These appeals stand disposed of accordingly.

WRIT PETITION NO. 295 OF 1992:

1. The present petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India is the second round of legal action connected to the safety and environmental aspects of Tehri Dam before this Court.

2. The petitioners herein firstly urge us; to issue necessary directions to conduct further safety tests so as to ensure the safety of the dam. Secondly, they allege that the concerned authorities have not correspondingly complied with the conditions attached to the Environmental Clearance dated July 19, 1990 and want us to halt the Project till the same is complied with. Lastly, they want us to look into the Rehabilitation aspects. Subsequent to the filing of this petition few others joined as intervenes. String of Affidavits, counter-affidavits and other documents disclosing the minutest details have been presented. Oral submissions on both sides have been addressed at length.

3. Before adverting to the contentions of safety, environmental clearance and rehabilitation, it is necessary to draw a demarcating line between the realm of policy and the permissible areas for judicial interference in the context of present case. For this, a brief factual survey is warranted. This is also necessary to appreciate the broader issues advanced before us.

4. Investigation for the purpose of construction of a dam at Tehri for hydel power generation was commenced as early as in 1961. In the year 1972, the Planning Commission envisaged a cost of Rs. 197.82 crores and in 1976, administrative clearance to the Project was given by the Government of U.P. In March 1980, a direction was issued by the then Prime Minister for an in-depth review of the whole project. Consequently, an Expert Group was constituted by the Ministry of Science and Technology. The Prime Minister's note on the file reads as follows:

""There are several proposals which were agreed to earlier but would need to be looked into again. Amongst them are Silent Valley, the dam in Tehri Garhwal and the dam in Lalpur, Gujarat. It seems that larger areas of very fertile land are being submerged without any commensurate gains. There may be other such cases also, it is true that these decisions have been taken over a period of time but there is great local distress and a feeling that contractors and other such groups will be the main gainers. Hence, it is necessary to have another look in depth.""

5. In May 1980, an interim report was submitted by the Expert Group and the final report was submitted in August 1986. Even though an expenditure of Rs. 206 crores has been incurred, the Expert Committee recommended to abandon the project. Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) accepted the report in October 1986 and endorsed the view of the Expert Committee. In November 1986, the erstwhile USSR offered administrative, technical and financial assistance on a turnkey basis and the Tehri Project was revived as recipient of such aid. In November 1986, a Protocol was signed with USSR for providing technical and financial assistance for this project to the tune of 1000M Roubles. Thus the need to obtain environmental clearances even in the absence of Environmental Action Plans became urgent so as to quickly complete all administrative and technical formalities. In January 1987, the Government announced in the Press that it has cleared the project after a thorough assessment of the impact of the project on environment and after satisfying themselves that the adverse impact on environment can be remedied. A general agreement was signed in Moscow and it was decided that the dam construction would be carried out jointly by Soviet and Indian Engineers, Thereafter, the project, which was initially executed by the Irrigation Department of the Government of U.P. has been taken over by the joint venture company of the Government of India and the Government of U.P. The company was called Tehri Hydro Development Corporation Ltd (THDC). In July 1989, Move revised cost estimates and released further funds, conditional to its prior environmental clearance. Accordingly, THDC formulated Environment Action Plans for consideration and assessment by Move. In February 1990, the Environmental Appraisal Committee, Move concluded that the Tehri Dam Project, as proposed, should not be taken up as it does not merit environmental clearance. Subsequently, On July 19, 1990, conditional clearance to the project was given by Move. It was specifically provided that completion of status, formulation of action plans and their implementation will be scheduled in such a manner that their execution is pan-pass with the construction, failing which the engineering works would be brought to a halt and this condition will be enforced among others under the provisions of the Environment Protection Act, 1986.

6. The petitioners raised the question before us that when a decision had been taken in 1990 to abandon the project as to how clearance could be given on July 19, 1990? Again they pointed out that on 21.10.1994 serious consequences of the implementation lagging behind was taken note of but the project was allowed to continue.

7. From the narration of various events set out earlier, it is clear that even by August 1986 an expenditure of Rs.206 crores had been incurred for the construction of the dam. It is after the THDC Action Plans for consideration and assessment by Move have been submitted. These were considered on two occasions: firstly, in February 1890 and again on July 19, 1090 and it is thereafter the conditional clearance was given. It is contended that the environmental clearance which was granted on July 19, 1990 is without proper application of mind and, therefore, the dam construction should not be allowed to proceed. The law on this aspect has been clearly set out in the decision of this Court in Narmada Bachao Andolan v. Union of India. MANU/SC/0640/2000MANU/SC/0640/2000 : AIR2000SC3751 . As in the present case, in the case of Sardar Sarovar Project also, four identical conditions were imposed and they are as under:

""(i) NCA will ensure that environmental safeguard measures are planned and implemented pari-passu with progress of work on project.

(ii) The detailed surveys' studies assured will be carried out as per the schedule proposed and details made available to the Department for assessment.

(Ill) the attachment area treatment programme and the rehabilitation plans be so drawn as to be completed ahead of reservoir filling,

(iv) The Department should be kept informed of progress on various works periodically.""

8. The effect of grant of clearance subject to pari-passu conditions has also been examined by this Court in Sardar Sarovar Project's case. It has been noticed therein that there are three stages with regard to the undertaking of an infrastructural project - the first of which is the conception or planning, second is decision to undertake the project and the third is the execution of the project. The conception and the decision to undertake a project has to be regarded as a policy decision.

9. In Sardar Sarovar Project case it was also held that when two or more options are possible and the Government takes a policy decision it is then not a function of the Court to re-examine the matter by way of appeal. Necessary analogy could also be drawn from BALCO Employees' Union (Reqd.) v. Union of India , MANU/SC/0779/2001MANU/SC/0779/2001 : (2002)ILLJ550SC .

10. Once such a considered decision is taken, the proper execution of the same should be undertaken expeditiously. It is for the Government to decide how to do its job. When it has put a system in place for the execution of the project and such a system cannot be said to be arbitrary, then the only role which the Court has to play is to ensure that the system works in the manner it was envisaged. It is made clear in that decision that the questions whether to have an in frastructual project or not and what is the type of project to be undertaken and how it has to be executed, are part of policy-making process and the courts are ill-equipped to adjudicate on a policy decision so undertaken. However, a note of caution was struck that the Courts have a duty to see that in the undertaking of a decision, no taw is violated and people's fundamental rights as guaranteed under the Constitution are not transgressed upon except to the extent permissible under the Constitution. When a law has been enacted in relation to the protection of environment and such law is being given effect to and there is no challenge to such law, the duty of the Courts would be to see that the Government and other respondents act in accordance with law and there is no other obligation for the Court to examine further in the matter. We respectfully agree with the view expressed in the Sardar Sarovar project's case and apply the same to the facts arising in this case.

11. Further, it was noticed in the aforesaid decision that in cases whore a project is taken up of the present nature, the Court will certainly bear in mind that environmental concern should be examined not only with reference to the submerged areas but also its surrounding areas. The impact has to be examined on the project as a whole and at the same time it should also be noticed that the construction of a dam would result in multifold improvement in the environment of the areas where the canal waters will reach. The benefits which have been reaped by the people all over India with the construction of the dams are too well-known and, therefore, the Government cannot be faulted for deciding to construct the high dam on river Tehri with a view to provide water and electricity in the area as was the decision in the Sardar Sarovar project's case also. In such situations, displacement of people residing in the proposed project sites and the areas to be submerged is an important issue. Therefore, a properly drafted relief and rehabilitation plan is absolutely required and the Government was also conscious of this particular fact. It, therefore, not only examined this matter on several occasions but also constituted an Expert Committee on 17.7.1996 to examine the environmental and rehabilitation aspects. Several times the matter was examined by the Government at different stages and follow up action plans also were actively considered by the Government. The report given by Hanumantha Rao Committee (HRC) was accepted by the Government subject to certain conditions and the project is being implemented in terms thereof.

12. Therefore, at this penultimate stage of the proceedings, it is too late in the day to think as to why the decision was taken to construct the project or decisions have been taken to continue the project though at one stage it was thought it would not be appropriate to continue the same.

13. With these clarifications, we will now proceed to the specific aspects of safety and conditional clearance.

Safety Aspect

14. Tehri Dam is being constructed at the confluence of the Bhagirathi and Bhilangana rivers in the neighborhood of the Garhwal town in the State of Uttaranchal. According to the petitioners the structure of the dam itself is not safe and also alleged that its existence increases the seismic vulnerability of the entire Himalayan region. By way of abundant caution they want the concerned authorities to conduct Three-Dimensional (3D) Non-Linear Test to evaluate the earthquake susceptibility of the dam against the Maximum Credible Earthquake. They also insist upon the computer simulated Dam Break Analysis to estimate the magnitude of damages in the unexpected eventuality of any dam failure. The respondents submitted that they explored the possibility of such tests and arrived at a conclusion that such tests are neither practical nor necessary in the present case.

15. The respondents added that the studies related to site specific assessment of seismicity, testing of fill materials for determining dynamic properties and detailed dynamic analysis, were carried out independently by two agencies; that they are the Department of Earthquake Engineering, University of Roorkee, and Hydro Project Institute (HPI), Moscow; that the result of their studies indicated that earth and rockfill type dams as chosen for Tehri are the safest man-made structures in earthquake prone zones due to their large inertia, high damping and high flexibility; that the dam fill material is being compacted to concrete like density, which provides high strength while retaining the flexibility; that relatively flat slopes have been adopted for up-stream and down stream of the dam, which are flatter than the slopes provided in some recent high dams built/planned in regions of similar high seismicity; that, therefore, the Tehri Dam is a fail-safe structure and the design has been found safe against the worst earthquake scenario of the area, even when very conservative and severe seismic parameters were assumed for these tests. A high level Committee under the Chairmanship of Director General, Geological Survey of India, which consists members from Central Water Commission; Director, National Geophysical Research Institute; Head of Department of Earthquake Engineering, University of Roorkee, and Dr. V.K. Gaur, the then Secretary, Department of Ocean Development was also constituted to examine issues concerning safety of the dam. The Committee in its report established that even in the worst scenario of possible occurrence of a large magnitude earthquake of 8+ in richter scale with the probable location at a depth of 15 km below the dam site, the same would be safe. They concluded that dam design is safe and added that all danger arising out of the seismicity have been taken note of and taken care of in the planning of Tehri Dam project.

16. From the documents before us, it could be gathered that the Government also referred the matter to Seismic Expert, Prof. Jai Krishna who was the former President of International Academy of Earthquake Engineering and also Vice-Chancellor of the University of Roorkee. He examined the matter and opined that ""the proposed dam section for the Tehri Project is safe from the point of view of seismicity of the region"" and ""since conservatism has entered at almost every step of decision making, the overall factor of safety of the dam is high enough to eliminate any risk from earthquake of the future."" The next Expert Group that consisted of the Director General, Geological Survey of India, made a report on 25.7.1991 and recommended that the reports of the High Level Committee and the review given by Prof, Jai Krishna should be accepted. The seismic stability of the dam was further got tested through the Hydro Project Institute, Moscow, against actual acceleo gram of the Gazli earthquake for the maximum vertical acceleration of 1.36g and horizontal acceleration of 0.72g both acting simultaneously and the dam design was again found to be safe. Even though the design of the dam had been earlier independently checked by two separate agencies, it was again examined and it was found that the project appears to be safe. Subsequently, during the pendency of this petition, in order to allay fears expressed in certain quarters, the Government of India in June 1996 appointed a Group of Five Experts to examine the relevant scientific and technical reports and other information relating to safety of the Tehri Dam and make its recommendations to the Government for consideration. In the selection of the experts Shri Sundarlal Bahuguna, who has been spearheading the movement against the construction of the Tehri Dam, was also associated and he recommended the inclusion of two engineers apart from the three seismologist. Thus the names of all the five Experts were suggested by Shri Bahuguna. The Group of Five Experts, after a detailed discussion on the various issues related to the seismic safety of the Tehri Dam, concluded that a comprehensive appraisal of the seismic safety of the dam required completion of the two key exercises by employing recent advances in conceptual and computational capabilities and they are, (i) quantitative estimation of seismic hazard at all the Tehri Dam site, and (ii) evaluation of the performance of the Tehri Dam as currently designed, if it was exposed to the estimated seismic hazard at the site. Accordingly, the Group or Experts got conducted the necessary exercises at their own decided parameters and methods. The Group also considered the International Commission on Large Dams Guidelines on Earthquake Analysis Procedure for Dams and Seismicity and Dam Design. Based on these materials the Group of Experts finally submitted the report on 18.2.1998. They concluded that the ""present design of the Dam is expected to be structurally safe to withstand the maximum credible earthquake during the economic performance life of the dam-reservoir system."" The Group of Experts was unanimous in their recommendation as stated above. However, as a matter of abundant caution , four Experts suggested (i) 3-D Non-Linear analysis of the Dam to evaluate its performance against the maximum credible earthquake and (ii) a simulated dam Break analysis to ensure that in the unlikely event of an uncontrolled release of water, the consequences are minimum, be conducted. There was difference of opinion between the four Experts and the Fifth Expert only on the need to undertake these two additional studies as a matter of abundant caution. The Government of India, after receipt of the report of the Group of Experts, examined the further recommendation of the four out of five Experts in consultation with the Central Water Commission, which is a technical body of the Government and nodal agency in the country for planning and design of River Valley Projects who in turn referred the report of the Expert Group together with the need for carrying out the work recommended by way of abundant caution to the National Committee on Seismic Design Parameters which is a standing technical committee and it furnished its views. In addition, plethora of material has been placed by way of various text books and studies carried out by other agencies. We think that it is neither feasible nor proper for us to delve into these details. The Government of India, after considering the views thereof, finally decided that there was no necessity to undertake the work recommended further by the Four Experts by way of abundant caution and clearance to the project was given.

17. In Tehri Bandh Virodhi Sangarsh Samiti v. State of UP , MANU/SC/0540/1992MANU/SC/0540/1992, the grant of clearance on July 19, 1990 was called in question before this Court in a writ petition and this Court examined the safety aspects which were brought to the notice of the court and it was held that the clearance given was not as a result of non-application of mind by the Government on safety and environmental aspects and it was particularly examined with reference to the fact that site of the project is being within the earthquake prone zone and this Court, after specific examination of the record observed that the project was considered by the Environmental Appraisal Committee of Move, Committee of Secretaries, High Level Committee comprising experts of scientific and specialised organisations and also by a renowned expert of international repute and, therefore, the Government considered the question of safety of the project from various details more than once and on being satisfied with the reports of the experts gave clearance to the project. In those circumstances, this Court thought fit not to interfere with the same.

This Court dealt with the safety concerns and held that:

""...In our opinion the Court can only investigate and adjudicate the question as to whether the government was conscious to the inherent danger as pointed out by the petitioners and applied its mind to the safety of the dam. We have already given facts in detail, which show that the government has considered the question on several occasions in the light of the opinions expressed by the experts. The government was satisfied with the report of the experts and only thereafter clearance has been given to the project.""

18. In the present case the Government, even after the decision of this Court which did not interfere with the decision of the Government on safety aspects In Tehri Bandh Virodhi Sangarsh Samiti's case (supra) again seriously examined safety aspects as a matter of precaution. The Office Memorandum dated 1/2/1999 of the Ministry of Power, Government of India, before us testifies this position. Green signal for further works was given by the Government after satisfying itself with the safety of the dam. A mere revisit to the earlier decision cannot be counted as a sign of doubt regarding the dam safety. If the Government so desires they could have abandoned the Project. The necessity or effectiveness of conducting 3D Non-Linear Test or Dam Break Analysis were taken into account by the Government and if the Government decided not to conduct such tests upon the opinion of the concerned expert bodies, then the Court cannot advice the Government to go for such tests unless malafides, arbitrariness or irrationality is attributed to that decision. The decision of the Government is not based on any financial constraints or uncertainty as to technical opinion. It was clearly of the view that the last Committee was unanimous that the Tehri Dam to be constructed is safe but the advice based on abundant caution was not accepted. As a result, we need not re-examine the safety aspects of the dam.

19. This Court cannot sit in judgment over the cutting edge of scientific analysis relating to the safety of any project. Experts in science may themselves differ in their opinions while taking decisions on matters related to safety and allied aspects. The opposing viewpoints of the experts will also have to be given due consideration after full application of mind. When the Government or the concerned authorities after due consideration of all viewpoints and full application of mind took a decision, then it is not appropriate for the Court to interfere. Such matters must be left to the mature wisdom of the Government or the implementing agency. It is their forte. In such cases, if the situation demands, the Courts should take only a detached decision based on the pattern of the well-settled principles of administrative law. If any such decision is based on irrelevant consideration or non-consideration of material or is thoroughly arbitrary, then the Court will get in the way. Here the only point to consider is whether the decision-making agency took a well-informed decision or not. If the answer is 'yes' then there is no need to interfere. The consideration in such cases is in the process of decision and not in its merits.

20. In this context, reliance is sought to be placed on the decision of this Court in A.P. Pollution Control Board v. Prof. M.V. Nayudu (Retd.) and Ors. , MANU/SC/0032/1999MANU/SC/0032/1999 : [1999]1SCR235 . In that decision, this Court viewed that in scientific matters of complex nature resulting in uncertainty, reference has to be made to a specialised technical/expert body and not merely decide the matter on well known principles of administrative law of court not re-examining the matter if all relevant considerations have been taken note of. In the present case when once a decision had been given by this Court on safety aspects on an earlier occasion and thereafter the matter was again examined by the Government through different agencies and had taken a decision as to the necessity of further test by way of abundant caution should be relevant or not, we do not think, we can sit in judgment over such decision, particularly when there is no difference of opinion among the Experts as to the safety of the dam. It is only by way of abundant caution such studies were suggested by four out of five experts. Thus the usefulness or necessity thereof itself being in doubt, as expressed in various reports, and text books relied on by either side, the principle stated in A.P. Pollution Control Board's case (supra) cannot be applied. In that decision it was noticed that inadequacies of science had led to the precautionary principle leading to the principle of burden of proof in environmental cases where burden as to the absence of injurious effect of the actions proposed is placed on those who want to change the present state of affairs. After detailed consideration of this decision, it is held in Narmada Bachao Andolan's case (supra) :-

""It appears to us that the 'precautionary principle' and the corresponding burden of proof on the person who wants to change the status quo will ordinarily apply in a case of polluting or other project or industry where the extent of damage likely to be inflicted is not Know. When there is a state of uncertainty due to lack of data or material about the extent of damage or pollution likely to be caused then, in order to maintain the ecology balance, the burden of proof that the said balance will be maintained must necessarily be on the industry or the unit which is likely to cause pollution. On the other hand where the effect on ecology or environmental of setting up of an industry is know, what has to be seen is that if the environment is likely to suffer, then what mitigative steps can be taken to offset the same. Merely because there will be a change is no reason to presume that there will be an ecological disaster. It is when the effect of the project is known that the principle of sustainable development would come into play which will ensure that mitigative steps are and can be taken to preserve the ecological balance. Sustainable development means what type or extent or development can take place which can be sustained by nature/ecology with or without mitigation.

In the present case, we are not concerned with the polluting industry which is being established. What is being constructed is a large dam. The dam is neither a nuclear establishment nor a polluting industry. The construction of a dam undoubtedly would result in a change of environment but it wilt not be correct to presume that the construction of a large dam like the Sardar Sarovar will result in an ecological disaster India has an experience of over 40 years in the construction of dams. The experience does not show that construction of a large darn is not cost-effective or leads to ecological or environmental degradation. On the contrary there has been ecological upgradation with the construction of large dams. What is the impact an environment with the construction of a dam is well known in India and, therefore, the decision in A.P. Pollution Control Board case will have no application in the present case.""

Aspects Related to Conditional Clearance

21. Before adverting to other issues, certain aspects pertaining to the preservation of ecology and development have to be noticed. In Vellore Citizens Welfare Forum v. Union of India. MANU/SC/0686/1996MANU/SC/0686/1996 : AIR1996SC2715 , and in M.C Mehta v. Union of India, 2002 (4) SCC 353, it was observed that the balance between environmental protection and developmental activities could only be maintained by strictly following the principle of 'sustainable development.' This is a development strategy that caters the needs of the present without negotiating the ability of upcoming generations to satisfy their needs. The strict observance of sustainable development will put us on a path that ensures development while protecting the environment, a path that works for all peoples and for all generations. It is a guarantee to the present and a bequeath to the future. All environmental related developmental activities should benefit more people while maintaining the environmental balance. This could be ensured only by the strict adherence of sustainable development without which life of coming generations will be in jeopardy.

22. In a catena of cases we have reiterated that right to clean environment is a guaranteed fundamental right, May be in different context, the right to development is also declared as a component of Article 21 in cases like Samata v. State of Andhra Pradesh, MANU/SC/1325/1997MANU/SC/1325/1997 : AIR1997SC3297 , and in Madhu Kishore v. State of Bihar, MANU/SC/0468/1996MANU/SC/0468/1996 : AIR1996SC1864 .

23. The right to development cannot be treated as a mere right to economic betterment or cannot be limited to as a misnomer to simple construction activities. The right to development encompasses much more than economic well being, and includes within its definition the guarantee of fundamental human rights. The 'development' is not related only to the growth of GNP, in the classic work - 'Development As Freedom' the Nobel prize winner Amartya Sen pointed out that 'the issue of development cannot be separated from the conceptual framework of human right'. This idea is also part of the UN Declaration on the Right to Development. The right to development includes the whole spectrum of civil, cultural, economic, political and social process, for the improvement of peoples' well being and realization of their full potential. It is an integral part of human right. Of course, construction of a dam or a mega project is definitely an attempt to achieve the goal of wholesome development. Such works could very well be treated as integral component for development.

24. Therefore, the adherence of sustainable development principle is a sine qua non for the maintenance of the symbiotic balance between the rights to environment and development. Right to environment is a fundamental right. On the other hand right to development is also one. Here the right to 'sustainable development' cannot be singled out. Therefore, the concept of 'sustainable development' is to be treated an integral part of 'life' under Article 21. The weighty concepts like inter-generational equity (State of Himachal Pradesh v. Ganesh Wood Products, MANU/SC/0038/1996MANU/SC/0038/1996 : AIR1996SC149 ), public trust doctrine (M.C. Mehta v. Kamal Nath , MANU/SC/1007/1997MANU/SC/1007/1997 : (1997)1SCC388 ) and precautionary principle (Vellore Citizens), which we declared as inseparable ingredients of our environmental jurisprudence, could only be nurtured by ensuring sustainable development.

25. To ensure sustainable development is one of the goals of Environmental Protection Act, 1986 (for short 'the Act') and this is quiet necessary to guarantee 'right to life' under Article 21. If the Act is not armed with the powers to ensure sustainable development, it will become a barren shell. In other words, sustainable development is one of the means to achieve the object and purpose of the Act as well as the protection of 'life' under Article 21 . Acknowledgment of this principle will breath new life into our environmental jurisprudence and constitutional resolve. Sustainable development could be achieved only by strict compliance of the directions under the Act. The object and purpose of the Act -""to provide for the protection and improvement of environment"" could only be achieved by ensuring the strict compliance of its directions. The concerned authorities by exercising its powers under the Act will have to ensure the acquiescence of sustainable development. Therefore, the directions or conditions put forward by the Act need to be strictly complied with. Thus the power under the Act cannot be treated as a power simpliciter, but it is a power coupled with duty. It is the duty of the State to make sure the fulfillment of conditions or direction under the Act, Without strict compliance, right to environment under Article 21 could not be guaranteed and the purpose of the Act will also be defeated. The commitment to the conditions thereof is an obligation both under Article 21 and under the Act. The conditions glued to the environmental clearance for the Tehri Dam Project given by the Ministry of Environment vide its Order dated July 19, 1990 has to be viewed from this perspective.

26. The relevant portion of the environmental clearance certificate of the Tehri dam dated July 19, 1990 is verbatim extracted hereunder:

""Tehri Dam Project was initiated in 1972 for an installed capacity of 600 MW, now revised to 2400 MW to be taken up in three stages. The collection of data and preparation of environmental action plans is yet to be finally completed. Meanwhile, an amount of Rs. 440 crores has been spent on various project related works. The Department of Power and the Government of Uttar Pradesh have assured to furnish all the det"

M.B. Shah, J.

1. With respect I regret for my inability to agree with the judgment rendered by my learned brother Justice Agrawal. At the outset, it requires to be stated that this case illustrates how faulty, delayed, casual, unscientific investigation and lapse of long period in trial affects the administration of justice which in turn certain shakes the public confidence in the system. Is it not possible for the authorities to find out ways and means for speedy, efficient, scientific investigation in at least heinous brutal carnage and for trying the case within few months of occurrence? If this is not done, it is of no use to complaint that accused are not punished in such cases. In any case, for deciding such criminal case, it is the bounden duty of the court to appreciate the evidence brought on record, as it is, in accordance with established law without being influenced by the allegations leveled by the prosecuting agency or by the incident. Before appreciating the evidence, I would refer to the observations of this Court in State (Delhi Admn.) v. Laxman Kumar MANU/SC/0109/1985MANU/SC/0109/1985 : 1986CriLJ155 observed as under:-

""Mankind has shifted from the state of nature towards a civilized society and it is no longer the physical power of a litigating individual or the might of the ruler nor even the opinion of the majority that takes away the liberty of a citizen by convicting him and making him suffer a sentence of imprisonment. Award of punishment following conviction at a trial in a system wedded to rule of law is the outcome of cool deliberation in the court room after adequate hearing is afforded to the parties, accusations are brought against the accused, the prosecutor is given an opportunity of supporting the charge and the accused is equally given an opportunity of meeting the accusations by establishing his innocence. It is the outcome of cool deliberations and the screening of the material by the informed mind of the Judge that leads to determination of the lis...""

2. In the present case, in gruesome carnage, 35 persons lost their lives, some houses/huts were burnt, number of persons were injured and in that case charge-sheet was submitted against 119 persons. Out of them, 13 were tried by the Designated Court of Sessions Judge, Gaya in G.R. Case No. 430 of 1992, Tekari Police Station Case No. 19 of 1992 under the provisions of Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (hereinafter referred to as ""TADA Act"") and under Section 302/ 149 etc. of Indian Penal Code (hereinafter referred to as ""IPC""). After recording the evidence, by judgment and order dated 8.6.2001, the Designated Court.

(a) acquitted A-1 Nanhe Yadav @ Dina Yadav, A-10 Nanhak Teli, A-11 Naresh Chamar and A-12 Ramashish Mahto;

(b) convicted A-5 Bir Kuer Paswan, A-8 Krishna Mochi, A-9 Dharmendra Singh @ Dharo Singh, A-13 Nanhe Lal Mochi and sentenced to death;

(c) convicted A-2 Bihari Manjhi, A-1 Ramautar Dusadh @ Lakhan Dusadh, A-6 Rajendra Paswan, A-7 Wakil Yadav and imposed life imprisonment;

(d) convicted A-3 Ravindra Singh and imposed RI for ten years. He has not filed any appeal.

3. A-2 Bihari Manjhi, A-4 Ramautar Dusadh @ Lakhan Dusadh, A-6 Rajendra Paswan and A-7 Wakil Yadav have challenged impugned judgment and order in Criminal Appeals No. 752 and 765 of 2001 and by a separate judgment of even date, these accused stand acquitted by this Court on the ground that there is no evidence against them except the confessional statement of A-2 Bihari Manjhi which we have not relied upon for the reasons recorded therein.

4. By this judgment and order, Criminal Appeal No. 761 of 2001 filed by A-5 Bir Kuer Paswan alias Beer Kuer Dusadh, A-8 Krishna Mochi, A-9 Dharmendra Singh alias Dharo Singh, A-13 Nanhe Lal Mochi and the Death Reference No. 1 of 2001 filed by the State against these accused, are disposed of.

5. In heinous crime, where 35 persons lost their lives, prosecution has not examined the informant Satendra Kumar Sharma, therefore, it would be difficult to refer to the contents of the FIR. However, we would refer to evidence of PW33 Vijay Pratap Singh, Inspector, who was station-in-charge of police station Tekari. It is his say that on 12th February, 1992 at about 10.00 p.m. when he was ready for patrolling, all of a sudden he head noise of explosions. He, therefore, along with the sub-inspector and other available armed force jawans left the police station for finding out as to what has happened. On the way, he met Sidheshwar Yadav, who was the mukhia of the village but he was not having any information with regard to the incident. He along with Sidheshwar Yadav started for going ahead. After going at some distance, they saw that the sky was red because of flames. Thereafter, they approached village Dihura and saw one Krishna Yadav and Bhola Paswan, Chowkidars of the village and Ram Yogesh Singh, Dafadar. PW33 enquired from them about the lit up village towards the cast of village Dihura. It is his say that they were frightened and informed him that some party people have attacked the village Bara. They used the word ""party"" for militants. As he was hearing the noises of bombs and bullets, he gave information to the Superintendent of Police who directed him to proceed towards the place of occurrence. They left the mobile jeep on the road and when they were proceeding towards village Bara they were attacked by the extremists from the western side of village Bara. They also opened fire in self defence. Meantime, Superintendent of Police reached there at about 11.30 p.m. along with police force. It is his say that thereafter they reached village Bara at about 1.00 a.m., where they heard the slogan ""whoever comes near the village will be eliminated"". After some shouts, one young person whose hands were tied at the back came running and on being asked he told that he was Shravan Kumar. After seeing that police has arrived, militants started running towards the East. When they entered the village there was total quietness. They found the bridge on the canal about 200 yards east of the village. They found dead bodies of people scattered in the fields. Their hands were tied at the back and their throats were slit. Thereafter, information was conveyed immediately to Inspector General of Police, Gaya and other senior police officers. He took the injured for medical treatment at Magadh Medical College Hospital. Informant Satendra Kumar Sharma gave statement Ex. 8, which was recorded as fard beyan. Thereafter, the formal F.I.R. Ex. 9 was written by Ram Janam Singh, Inspector of PS Tekri. It is his say that place of incident is village Bara which is about 5 km. from the police station Tekri. In the said village, there are 50 houses, out of which 5 are those Brahmins, 1 of Harijan, 1 of Gwala community and the rest of the houses are those of bhumihar community. The militants took the villagers from their houses in the field adjacent to Shiv Mandir situated at a distance of 20 yards on the northern side of the village, from where they took them in the grass field and then to the bridge on the eastern side of the canal and after tying their hands with their own clothes killed them by slitting their throats. It is his say that one Nanhe Yadav, A-1, was arrested from Alipur bus stand on 17.2.1992. His statement was recorded and thereafter he was sent to judicial custody. The statement of other witnesses could not be recorded as no witness as under condition of giving statement. Thereafter, Superintendent of Police on 17.2.1992 directed that the investigation of the incident should be conducted by Inspector Ram Japit Kumar. As Ram Japit Kumar was not available, investigation was handed over to Inspector Suresh Chander Sharma. In cross-examination, he admitted that the entire investigation was conducted by Ram Japit Kumar. He had not recorded the statement of any witness including that of Chowkidars Krishna Yadav and Bhola Paswan and Dafadar Ram Yogesh Singh. He also admitted that daily diary entry No. 262 of 1992 was not with him. He admitted that he had not seen the notification of TADA. He had not taken approval of Superintendent of Police and Director General of Police before commencing investigation and he began investigation upon oral instructions of Superintendent of Police and thereafter handed over the investigation to Subhash Chander Sharma (PW17). He denied the suggestion that Ram Japit Kumar found the accused persons named in the FIR to be innocent and that to suppress the investigation done by Ram Japit Kumar and diary written by him, he had written an anti-dated diary and that was done to till-up the gap of investigation carried out by Ram Japit Kumar.

6. It is to be stated that Ram Japit Kumar is not examined by the prosecution, even though he was the Inspector of Tekari police station and it is on the record that he also conducted investigation of this case, nor his case diary is brought on record.

7. PW2 Sunil Kumar, Superintendent of Police is also examined. It is his say that after receipt of the information he along with armed force reached village Bara at about 12.15 to 12.30 in the night on the day of incident. There he saw lot of people had been killed by slitting their throats. Some houses had also been set on fire. Some persons were lying injured and they were sent to hospital in police vehicle. On 27.2.1992, he received information of the arrest of Behari Manjhi of village Bhat Bigha, P.S. Bodhgaya. He went there and informed Behari Manjhi that whatever statement he wanted to give, he should make without fear or favour and thereafter he recorded the confessional statement of Behari Manjhi under TADA Act. That statement was recorded by Suresh Chander Sharma, Inspector P.S. Chandauti. Before the court, he could not identify who was Behari Manjhi. In cross-examination, he stated that all the police personnel of P.S. Tekari including the station-in-charge were involved in arresting the accused persons and that number of VIPs were visiting the place and the police officers were busy. Therefore, investigation was entrusted to Police Inspector of P.S. Chandauti. he did not remember as to whether they took written permission to invoke TADA Act. He also stated that he cannot say that under the TADA Act investigation can be carried out only by an officer of the rank of DSP or above.

8. PW32 Virendra Kumar Singh, who was posted as station-in-charge of P.S. Bodhgaya, stated about arrest of Behari Manjhi, Ravindra Singh and Raghubir Kahar in connection with Lavlesh Police Station Case No. 28/92 under the Arms Act. In cross-examination, he admitted that he is accused in a murder case and that he has filed appeal before Supreme Court for quashing or cognizance taken against him in connection with death of one Vasuki Yadav, nephew of Wakil Yadav, who is one of the accused in the present case.

9. From the aforesaid evidence of police officers, it appears that in a carnage where brutal and heinous murders took place, the investigation was not proper and statements were not recorded immediately for one or the other reason. The prosecution has also failed at least to examine the informant Satendra Kumar Sharma. Keeping these facts in background, I would now refer to the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the appellants. The case of the prosecution against these convicted accused depends upon the evidence of PW5 Belmati Devi, PW6 Birendra Singh, PW7 Lavlesh Singh, PW8 Yogendra Singh, PW11 Brajesh Kumar, PW12 Gopal Singh, PW16 Ram Sagar Singh, PW18 Budhan Singh, PW19 Dhananjay Singh, PW20 Bunda Singh, PW21 Sumiran Sharma, PW22 Krishna Devi, PW23 Rajmani Devi and PW29 Lalita Devi. Hence, rest of the evidence is not required to be discussed.

10. Apart from these witnesses, to prove the injuries to the dead and injured witnesses, the prosecution has examined four doctors namely, PW1 Dr. Kapildeo Prasad, PW13 Dr. Arvind Kumar, PW14 Dr. Arjun Singh and PW15 Dr. Mukti Nath Singh. Learned counsel for the appellants-accused has not disputed the injuries caused to the deceased or to the witnesses, therefore, that aspect is not required to be dealt with in this appeal.

11. Mr. U.R. Lalit and Mr. Sushil Kumar, senior counsel appearing on behalf of accused mainly submitted that--

1. the identification of the accused is not reliable one;

2. even if it is held that accused were present in the mob of 600-700 persons, there is no justifiable reasons for connecting the accused with the crime;

3. no witness has stated that accused were armed with any deadly weapons;

4. no witness has stated that any of the accused took part in murder of any of the deceased or of causing any injury to any witness or setting fire to the houses;

5. there is no recovery of any arms or any incriminating articles from any of the accused;

6. the statements of witnesses are recorded after long lapse of time, mostly after more than 20-22 days;

7. all the witnesses are 'got up' witnesses.

8. none of the witnesses stated that accused were members of Maoists Community center--an extremist group;

9. in any set of circumstances, presuming that accused are identified but mere presence in the mob would not justify imposition of death sentence.

12. The evidence of witnesses who identified the accused before the court can be divided as under--

13 It is the say of PW5 Belmati Devi that before 8-years when they were sleeping, they heard bullets and guns booming. Some terrorists broke open their doors and entered into the house. They took her husband, whose both hands were burnt, along with them. The militants were holding torches and were shouting ""long live red salute, and whoever comes in our way would be eliminated"". After her attention was drawn to police statement, she stated that she could identify Raja Ram Mochi, Nand Lal Mochi, Naresh Paswan and Krishna Mochi, all residents of Bara Bhat Bigha. Thereafter, in the cross-examination, she admitted that militants came in police uniform and that they were unknown persons. She had not seen militants or naxalities earlier or subsequent to the incident. She denied the suggestion that she had not stated before the police that militants took her husband in their laps and they were shouting slogans. She also admitted that she had not stated before the police about identifying Raja Ram, Naresh Paswan, Krishna Mochi and Nanhe Lal Mochi.

14. In view of aforesaid admissions, no reliance can be placed upon her evidence to connect any accused with the crime.

15. PW6 Birender Singh after narrating the facts has stated that on the day of incident, the militants took them to a place near the canal under the bridge. The militants were cutting the throats by a Pasuli. Mahinder Ravi Das, Yugal Ravi Das and Bhugal Ravi Das were amongst the militants. He was hit by Pasuli on the neck, he fell down and the militants left him untouched thinking that he was dead. The names of the persons to whom he identified were given to the police. He again stated that Nanhe Yadav, Mahender Ravi Das, Yugal Ravi Das, Bhugal Ravi, Kirani Yadav alias Surajdev Yadav, Janeshwar Ji alias Bholaji, Vyas Ram, Akhilesh Thakur, Girija Mochi, Naresh Chamar, Vyas Yadav, Suresh Yadav, Vinod Singh, Dharo Singh, Ramashish Mahto, Suraj Pandit, Krishna Mochi, Rajender Paswan, Ramrup Chamar were amongst the militants. He could identify only Krishna Mochi, A-8, who was present in the mob, and stated that since a long time has lapsed he cannot identify others. It is his say in the cross-examination that the persons whose names he has mentioned, were seen by him every day and that some of the militants used to come to work in their houses. It is his say that after he returned from hospital, his statement was recorded after 25 days of the occurrence. However, PW17 Investigating Officer Suresh Chander Sharma has specifically stated that witness did not name Krishna Mochi among the accused persons in his police statement. Hence, no reliance can be placed on evidence of this witness to connect any of the accused with the crime.

16. PW29 Lalita Devi stated that the incident is of about 8-9 years old. The militants surrendered their village and they were armed with guns and ammunition. The incident took place at 9:00 p.m. The militants entered into their house by breaking the door. Amongst the militants, she could identify Krishna, Yugal, Bhugal and Nanhe Lal Mochi. Her statement was recorded after 5/6 days. She however, stated that since her eye-sight has become weak, she cannot identify anybody.

17. Even though this witness had named Krishna Mochi (A-8) and Nanhe Lal Mochi (A-3) but as she could not identify any of the accused in the Court, her evidence is of no value.

Evidence Against Appellant No. 1 Krishna Mochi (A-8)-

18. For identification of this accused, there is evidence of PW8, PW16, PW19 and PW20.

19. PW8 Yogender Singh is another injured witness. It is his say that on 12.2.1992 between 9.00 and 9.15 p.m. extremists raided their house. He was sleeping along with his brothers Bunda Singh, Madan Singh and Mithilesh Singh and guests Nagender Singh, Satender Singh s/o Guriban Singh. All of a sudden, they heard the noise of bullets and bombs. The people of the village started running here and there. Vidya Budhan Singh of their village came and did himself in their house. The extremists armed with the weapons attacked his house. When he went out of his house, he saw that there was fire everywhere. The extremists broke open the doors of their house, entered the house and tied their hands. Thereafter, the extremists took them to the canal and there they saw that a number of residents of the village were already present there and the extremists were surrounding them. After reaching there, they saw Muneshwar Singh, Siaram Singh, Ashudev Singh and Suresh Singh of their village were being brought by the extremists. Their hands were also tied at the back. Then the extremists brought some villagers from the Mandir. Thereafter, they started tying their legs with the help of 'dhoti' and 'ghamchi'. Thereafter, the extremists started slitting their throats. His throat was also slit. He stated that he can identify the accused who were slitting the throats. Among those persons, there were Mahender Mochi, Yugal Mochi, Bhugal Mochi, Kirani Yadav @ Surajdev Yadav and Nanhak Teli. Further, Raja Ram, Naresh Paswan, Naresh Chamar, Kirani Yadav, Maksudan Sharma, Akhilesh Thakur, Nanhe Lal Mochi were also present at the scene of offence. However, he could identify only Krishna Mochi (A-8) and Nanhe Lal Mochi (A-13) out of 13 accused present in the court, but could not identify other accused because of passage of time. He also stated that the accused identified by him were of Tola Bhat Bigha of village Bara and that they used to work in agricultural land as labourers. It is his say in the cross-examination that he stayed in Magadh Medical College Hospital for 24 days because of injuries on throat and leg. It was also suggested to him in cross-examination that he had named the other accused falsely because of the politics of village and that he had not identified any of the accused all the time of occurrence.

20. From the evidence of this witness, it appears that he had named number of persons but thereafter could identify only two persons. Hence, there was no reason for the witness to say that he could identify the other accused persons whom he has named. This would indicate that he falsely deposed to a large extent involving number of persons. Further, this witness has not stated Krishna Mochi's name in first part of his statement. Name of Nanhe Lal Mochi is given only as a person, who was present at the scene of occurrence.

21. PW16 Ram Sagar Singh stated that militants were armed with rifles, guns and bullets, they burnt the entire village and that he can identify Mahender Mochi, Krishna Mochi, Nanhe Lal Mochi, Yugal Mochi, Bhugal Mochi who were amongst the militants. However, he could identify only Nanhe Lal Mochi and Krishna Mochi present in the court. It is his say in cross-examination that he saw militants from the top of the roof. He denied the suggestion that there was a long standing dispute between him and Nanhe Lal Mochi and Krishna Mochi and, therefore, he has falsely implicated them.

22. Next witness is PW19 Dhananjay Kumar, who also stated that extremists started slitting their throats and he was attacked with Pasuli, as a result of which his left ear and throat were slit. He became unconscious and gained consciousness at medical college hospital. After regaining consciousness he informed the police about accused persons, which included Nanhe Yadav, Chamar, Bir Kuer Paswan, Nanhe Lal Mochi, Ramashish Mahto, Dharo Singh @ Dharmender Singh, Krishna Mochi, Mahender Ravi Das, Yugal Mochi, Bhugal Mochi, Girija Mahto, Kirani Yadav, Suraj Pandit, Ramroop Chamar, Suresh Yadav, Janeshwar Ji @ Bhola Ji, Vinod Singh, Akhilesh Thakur, Rajinder Paswan. Thereafter, he stated that he can identify the persons whose names he has stated. He wrongly identified Nanhe Lal Mochi and Bir Kuer Paswan. However, he identified Krishna Mochi correctly and thereafter he stated that it was difficult to identify accused after 7 years. In cross-examination, to the suggestion given to him that he did not give names of Krishna Mochi and Nanhe Lal Mochi to the police, he stated that he gave their names to the police and if the police did not record their names, he was not knowing about it. He further denied the suggestion that there was long pending dispute about a passage through his and Dharo Singh's village. He has also denied the suggestion that there was a dispute between him and Krishna Mochi and, therefore, he had named him.

23. Similarly, PW20 Bunda Singh has stated that among the extremists, there were Kirani Yadav, Mahender Mochi, Maksudan Sharma, Raja Ram Mochi, Akhilesh Thakur, Nanhak Teli, Naresh Paswan, Naresh Mochi, Bhugal Mochi, Yugal Mochi. Nanhe Lal Mochi and Krishna Mochi, whom he had identified. It is his further say that Satendra Singh, the informant was member of his family. He could identify only Krishna Mochi in the Court and wrongly identified Nanhe Lal Mochi. He stated that because of long lapse of time there has been a change and, therefore, it was difficult for him to identify them. A suggestion was given to him in the cross-examination that there was a long standing dispute with regard to construction of road. He stated that he had not suffered any injury and that is statement was recorded after two days of the incident. He further stated that accused Nanhe Lal Mochi and Krishna Mochi belong to Bhat Bigha and other accused belong to various other villages. He denied the suggestion that he had not named the militants who entered in his house.

24. From the aforesaid evidence, it would be apparent that almost all witnesses have named number of persons but have failed to identify them. Only one or two accused are identified in the court. Their identification parade was not held by the police. However, at the most, it can be said that PW8 and PW6 have identified A-8 Krishna Mochi and A-13 Nanhe Lal Mochi, PW19 and PW20 have identified A-8 Krishna Mochi.

Evidence Against Appellant No. 2 Dharmendra Singh @ Dharo Singh (A-9)-

25. PW11 Brijesh Kumar after narrating the facts of the incident stated that he saw Mahender Ravi Das, Yugal Mochi, Bhugal Mochi, Kirani @ Surya Dev Yadav, Janeshwar, Nanhak Teli @ Mudkatwa, Ram Janam Singh, Dharmender Singh @ Dharo Singh. He identified Dharmendra Singh @ Dharo Singh in the Court. He wrongly identified Dina Yadav as Nanhak Teli. He stated that since a lot of time has lapsed, he is unable to identify Nanhak Teli.

26. Even though this witness had identified A-9 in the dock but his statement cannot be relied on the ground that PW17 IO Suresh Chander Sharma has specifically stated that this witness did not name A-9 Dharo Singh @ Dharmender Singh in his statement given to the police.

27. PW21 Ram Sumiran Sharma after narrating story stated that at the time of incident he could identify Nanhe Yadav, Yugal Mochi, Bhugal Mochi, Rajender Paswan, Beer Kuer Paswan, Dharo Singh @ Dharmender Singh, Suraj Pandit, Ram Janam Singh, Nanhak Teli, Kirani Yadav, Vyas Ram and Vyas Yadav and that he was not remembering names of other persons to whom he identified there. In the Court, he could identify only A-5 Beer Kuer Paswan, A-9 Dharo Singh @ Dharmender Singh and A-13 Nanhe Lal Mochi.

28. As stated above, no reliance can be placed on the evidence of PW11. The evidence of PW21 shows that he had named number of persons seen by him at the scene of offence but in the Court he could identify only three accused including A-9.

Evidence Against Appellant No. 3 Nanhe Lal Mochi (A-1)-

29. For identification of this accused, there is evidence of PW8, PW16, PW18, PW21 and PW22.

30. PW8 and PW16 have identified A-13. Their evidence is dealt with above.

31. PW18 Budhan Singh stated that at the time of offence, he saw one militant took out Pasuli and slit the neck of his son Sunil Singh, Ram Janam Singh and Shiv Janam Singh. He saw about 15 persons involved in slitting the throats of the people assembled there by using Pasuli. He became unconscious. It is his say that police recorded his statement and that amongst the militants there were Nanhe Lal Mochi, Yugal and Bhugal, whom he identified. In the court, he identified Nanhe Lal Mochi by going close to him. In cross-examination, it was suggested to him that he had not given the name of Nanhe Lal Mochi to the police and that he had not identified anybody. He denied the suggestion that because of an old animosity with Nanhe Lal Mochi he gave his name in the case.

32. PW21 has also identified this witness and his evidence is dealt with above.

33. Next witness is PW22 Kishna Devi. After narrating the prosecution story, she stated that persons who had been killed and injured belonged to bhumihar community and that she had given the names of certain extremists but as long time had lapsed, she cannot give their names and was having difficulty in identifying them. However, she identified Nanhe Lal Mochi. She deemed the suggestion that she had not given the name of Nanhe Lal Mochi to the police amongst the persons who were present at the scene of offence.

34. From the evidence of the aforesaid witnesses, it is apparent that despite naming number of persons, they could identify only one or two persons in the Court and gave the reason that due to lapse of long time, they were not able to identify the others.

Evidence Against Appellant No. 4 Bir Kuer Paswan (a-5)-

35. For identification of this accused, there is evidence of PW7 Lavlesh Singh and PW21 Ram Sumiran Sharma.

36. PW7 Lavlesh Singh also narrated the prosecution version and thereafter stated that among the people who were slitting throats were Mohinder Mochi, Nanhak Yadav, Nanhak Teli, Bir Kunwar Paswan, Rajinder Paswan, Bhugal Mochi, Yugal Mochi, Vyas Ram, Akhilesh Thakur, Gira Verma, Kirani @ Suraj Dev Yadav and lot of other people whose names he was not knowing. However, in the Court, he could identify Bir Kunwar Paswan and stated that he cannot identify others. In the cross-examination, he stated that he had seen the accused only on the date of occurrence and that is why he had taken their names. He also used to see those people in market and used to hear their names. He further stated that Bir Kuer Paswan was not working in his village as labourer. He clarified that when militants entered his house, he became unconscious and regained consciousness at Medical College Hospital.

37. PW21 has also identified this accused and his evidence has been dealt with above. PW7 could identify only A-5 and PW21 could identify A-5, A-9 and A-13.

38. Likewise, both the witnesses named number of persons but could not identify all the named persons.

In such state of evidence, the question would be--who could be convicted and what sentence could be awarded?

39. This Court in Kamaksha Rai and Ors. v. State of U.P. MANU/SC/0628/1999MANU/SC/0628/1999 : 2000CriLJ178 dealt with the incident where large number of people exceeding 500 in number were alleged to have taken part in attacking backward class persons by upper class, and observed that considering the nature of the attack and the possibility or otherwise of the identification of these accused persons by the prosecution witnesses and bearing in mind the principles laid down by this Court in Masalti v. State of Uttar Pradesh MANU/SC/0074/1964MANU/SC/0074/1964 : [1964]8SCR133 , which was followed in Binay Kumar Singh v. State of Bihar MANU/SC/0088/1997MANU/SC/0088/1997 : 1997CriLJ362 , it is not sale to rely on he evidence of witnesses who speak generally and in an omnibus way without specific reference to the identity of the individuals and their specific overt acts in regard to the incident that took place in the Harijan basti. The Court also observed that as a rule of prudence it is necessary to fix a minimum number of witnesses needed to accept the prosecution case to base a conviction. The decision in Masalti's case (Supra) enunciating rule of caution is well established law uniformly followed all throughout. [Re: Baddi Venkata Narasayya and Ors. v. State of A.P. MANU/SC/0925/1998MANU/SC/0925/1998 : (1998)2SCC329 , State of A.P. v. Thukkidiram Reddy and Ors. MANU/SC/0490/1998MANU/SC/0490/1998 : 1998CriLJ4035 and Hukam Singh and Ors. v. State of Rajasthan MANU/SC/0574/2000MANU/SC/0574/2000 : 2001CriLJ511 .

40. The aforesaid rule of prudence is also required to be applied in the present case. As discussed above, A-9 Dharmendra Singh alias Dharo Singh is identified by only PW21. There is no other corroborative piece of evidence connecting the said accused with the crime. Hence, he is required to be given benefit of doubt.

41. For identification of rest of the accused i.e. A-5 Bir Kuer Paswan, A-8 Krishna Mochi and A-13 Nanhe Lal Mochi, there is evidence of two or more witnesses.

42. However, from the evidence discussed above, it can be stated as under--

(1) It is apparent that the investigation in the present case is totally defective. The investigating officers have not taken any care and caution of recording the statement of witnesses immediately. No identification parade of accused was held. Investigating officer is not examined. As observed by this Court in Jamuna Chaudhary and Ors. v. State of Bihar MANU/SC/0119/1973MANU/SC/0119/1973 : 1974CriLJ890 , it should not be forgotten that the duty of the Instigating Officers is not merely to bolster up a prosecution case with such evidence as may enable the Court to record a conviction but to bring out the real unvarnished truth. In the said case, the Court has also observed--where neither the prosecution nor the defence come out with the whole and unvarnished truth to enable the Court to judge where the rights and wrongs of the set of incidents lay, the courts can only try to guess or conjecture to decipher the truth if possible. But this may be done within limits to determine whether any reasonable doubt emerges on any point under consideration from proved facts and circumstances of the case. Further, this Court in Kishore Chand v. State of Himachal Pradesh MANU/SC/0374/1990MANU/SC/0374/1990 : 1990CriLJ2289 observed that--indulging in free fabrication of the record is a deplorable conduct on the part of an investigating officer which undermines the public confidence reposed in the investigating agency. Therefore, greater case and circumspection are needed by the investigating agency in this regard. It is time that the investigating agencies evolve new and scientific investigating methods, taking aid of rapid scientific development in the field of investigation. It is also the duty of the State, i.e. Central or State Governments to organise periodical refresher courses for the investigating officers to keep them abreast of the latest scientific development in the art of investigation and the march of law so that the real offence would be brought to book and the innocent would not be exposed to prosecution.

(2) It is also settled law that when accused are charged with heinous brutal murders punishable to the highest penalty prescribed by the Penal Code, the judicial approach in dealing with such cases has to be cautious, circumspect and careful. In case of defective investigation, the Court can rely upon the evidence led by the prosecution and connect the accused with the crime if found reliable and trustworthy. In Dilavar Hussain v. State of Gujarat MANU/SC/0015/1991MANU/SC/0015/1991 : 1991CriLJ15 , this Court dealt with a communal riot case which was con"

Arijit Pasayat, J.

1. No religion propagates terrorism or hatred. Love for all is the basic foundation on which almost all religions are founded. Unfortunately, some fanatics who have distorted views of religion spread messages of terror and hatred. They do not understand and realize what amount of damage they do to the society. Sometimes people belonging to their community or religion also become victims. As a result of these fanatic acts of some misguided people, innocent lives are lost, distrust in the minds of communities replaces love and affection for others. The devastating effect of such dastardly acts is the matrix on which the present case to which these appeals relate rests. On 16th March, 1993, just before the stroke of mid-night, people in and around B.B. Ganguly Street in the Bow Bazar Area of Calcutta heard deafening sounds emanating from thundering explosions which resulted in total demolition of a building and partial demolition of two other adjacent buildings situated at 267, 266 and 268A, B.B. Ganguly Street. Large number of people were trapped in and buried under the demolished buildings. It was indeed a very ghastly sight and large number of people died because of the explosions' impact and/ or on account of the falling debris. Human limbs were found scattered all around the area. Those who survived tried to rescue the unfortunate victims, police officers arrived at the spot immediately. The first information report was lodged at Bow Bazar Police Station for alleged commission of offence punishable under Sections 120B, 436, 302, 307 326 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short 'the IPC') and Sections 3 and 5 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 (in short 'The Explosive Act').

2. Considering the seriousness and gravity of the incident, the Commissioner of Police set up a special investigating team. On investigation 8 persons including the six appellants were found linked with the commission of offences. Arrests were made. While rescue operations were on, there was further explosion on 18.3.1993. The exploded bomb was handed over to the police officer after its examination on the spot by a Military Officer. Meanwhile, the pay loader picked up a gunny bag containing 22 live bombs. Afterwards, they were defused after examination. Certain materials were seized by the investigating team from the site of the occurrence and on examination, it was found that nitro-glycerin explosives were involved in the explosion. Large number of witnesses were examined.

3. Two of the accused persons, Pannalal Jaysoara (accused-appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 299/2002) and Mohd. Gulzar (accused-appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 494/2002) were arrested on 29.3.1993 and 13.5.1993 respectively. As they wanted to make their confessions, those were to be recorded before the Judicial Magistrate. Accordingly, their confessional statements were recorded by the magistrates (PWs. 81 and 82). Some of the accused persons were also identified by witnesses in the Test Identification Parade. On 11.6.1993, the Commissioner of Police on examination of the case diary, statement of witnesses, reports of the experts and confessional statements came to the conclusion that provisions of Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (in short The TADA Act') were applicable. Accordingly, sanction was accorded for prosecution of the accused persons under the said statute. Charge sheet was submitted on 14.6.1993.

4. Accused persons filed a writ application before the Calcutta High Court challenging the validity of the sanction and the order whereby the Designated Court took cognizance of the offences under the TADA Act. The High Court quashed the order of sanction and taking of cognizance. The matter was challenged before this Court by the prosecution. The appeal was allowed and the Designated Court was directed to proceed with the case in accordance with law with utmost expedition. [See: State of West Bengal and Anr. v. Mohd. Khalid and ors. etc. MANU/SC/0154/1995MANU/SC/0154/1995 : AIR1995SC785 ]. The Designated Court framed charges under Sections 120B, 436/34, 302/34 IPC, Sections 3 and 5 of the Explosive Act and under Sections 3(2)(1) and 3(3) of the TADA Act. As the accused persons facing trial pleaded innocence, trial was conducted.

5. The case of the prosecution, in short, is that the accused persons conspired and agreed to manufacture bombs illegally by using explosive to strike terror in the people, particularly, in the mind of the people living in Bow Bazar and its adjacent areas to adversely affect communal harmony amongst members of Hindu and Muslim communities. Pursuant to this criminal conspiracy and in pursuance of the common intention, they caused complete/partial destruction of properties by using the explosive substances. They committed murders knowing fully well that illegal manufacture of bombs by explosive substances in most likelihood would result in deaths or bodily injuries, by causing explosion. In causing explosion by unlawful and malicious user of explosive substances which was likely to endanger life or to cause serious injury to properties, they committed offences in terms of Sections 3 and 5 of the Explosive Act. The fact that they possessed explosive substances gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that such possession and control of the explosive substances were not for lawful object. Provisions of the TADA Act were applied on the allegation that pursuant to the conspiracy and in pursuance of the common intention they prepared bombs with huge quantities of explosive substances and highly explosive materials with intent to strike terror in the mind of the people adversely affecting communal harmony amongst the people belonging to Hindu and Muslim religions. Their terrorist activities resulted in the death of 69 persons, injuries to a large number of persons and destruction and damage to properties. As a result of these acts, commission of terrorist acts was facilitated.

6. Out of the 165 witnesses examined, three witnesses were picked up as star witnesses to prove the conspiracy and the connected acts. They are PW. 40 (Md. Sabir @ Natu), PW. 67 (Santosh Hazra) and PW 68 (Kristin Chow @ Kittu). By a detailed judgment, the Designated Court found the accused appellants guilty of offences punishable under Sections 120B IPC, Sections 3 and 5 of the Explosive Act and Section 3(2)(1) and 3(3) of the TADA Act read with Section 34 IPC. However, they were found not guilty of the offences in terms of Sections 302 and 436 read with Section 34 IPC. After hearing on the question of sentence, the accused appellants were sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Rs. 3000/- each for commission of offences under Section 3(2)(1) of the TADA act read with Section 34 IPC, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for five years and to pay a fine of Rs. 500/- each for commission of offence under Section 3(3) of the TADA Act. They were further sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years to pay a fine of Rs. 1,000/- each for commission of offence under Section 6 of the Explosive Act and to suffer an imprisonment for one year and to pay a fine of Rs. 300/- each for commission of offence under Section 5 of the Explosive Act. Each of them were also sentenced to imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Rs. 3000/- each for commission of offence under Section 120B of IPC.

7. These appeals relate to the common judgment of the Designated Court. While the accused appellants have questioned the legality of the conviction and sentences imposed, the State has questioned the propriety of acquittal in respect of the offences in terms of Sections 302/34 and 436/34 IPC. Learned counsel for the accused appellants have submitted, inter alia, that the so-called star witnesses are persons with doubtful antecedents. They were rowdy elements who were under the thumb of police officers and the possibility of their having deposed falsely at the behest of police officers cannot be ruled out, and this is more probable. Referring to the evidence of PWs 40, 67 and 68, it was submitted that their evidence suffers from innumerable fallacies. PW-40 claimed to have heard the accused-appellant, Rashid asking the accused-appellant, Pannalal Joysoara about the preparation of bombs. He was the witness who was available immediately after the incident. But his statement was recorded two days after without any explanation being offered as to why he was examined two days after. Similarly, PWs. 67 and 68, were also examined after two days. In Court, they made embellished and highly ornamented statements. It was pointed out that evidence of PW-67, in particular, is full of holes. According to his own testimony, he was only connected with satta games. It was, therefore, highly improbable that he was allowed to go up and notice all those materials which were lying in the rooms and the activities being carried out. It was highly improbable that nobody stopped him. Many independent witnesses were not examined though their presence is accepted by the prosecution. A grievance is made that some of the persons who were available to be examined have not been so done. Particular reference has been made to Nausad and Osman. It is stated that the prosecution case is that Nausad was the owner of one of the premises and PW-68 told Osman about the conspiracy. Non-examination of these material and independent witnesses rendered the prosecution version suspect. There was no reliable evidence of conspiracy. There was no design to commit any act even if it is accepted that there was any explosion. That was an accident. In fact, no importance can be attached to the so-called judicial confessions because two accused persons who allegedly made the confession had made retraction subsequently on 3.2.1995. They were terrorized, threatened and were compelled to make the confession. Even if, according to them, the prosecution case is accepted in its toto, it only proves that the Muslims were trying to protect themselves in the event of a possible attack of Hindus on them. In the bomb blast which took place in Bombay a few months earlier, the police was totally ineffective and could not save the lives of number of Muslims and were silent onlookers. That spread message of fear in the mind of Muslims and as the prosecution version itself goes to show, they were preparing to protect themselves as a matter of exercise of their right of private defence, in the most likely event of attack by the Hindus on them. This according to them rules out application of the TADA Act. They were not the aggressors and their preparations to protect their rights and properties in the event of an attack was not to spread a terror or to cause any unlawful act but was an act intended to be used as a shield and not a weapon. Further, Section 3 of the Explosive Act has no application because there was no material to show that the accused persons had caused explosion. It was pointed out that several persons who had lost their lives in the explosion were arrayed as accused persons. Even if, they caused the explosion, they could not save their own lives and it cannot be said that the accused appellants were responsible for the explosion. Coming to the charge of conspiracy, it was submitted that the statements recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short The Code') of the two accused persons cannot be used against others unless the prescriptions of Section 30 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (in short 'The Evidence Act') were fulfilled. According to them, confession of a co-accused was not a substantive piece of evidence. It had a limited role to play. In case other evidence was convincing and credible, as an additional factor, confession of a co-accused for limited purpose can be used in evidence. The present was not a case of that nature. Finally, it was submitted that accused appellants are in custody since 1993 and a liberal view on sentence should be taken.

8. In response, Mr. K.T.S. Tulsi, learned senior counsel appearing for the prosecution submitted that the apparent intention of the accused appellants was to terrorise the people. Large quantity of the explosives and bombs recovered clearly gives a lie to the plea that self-protection Was the object. Seen in the context of the motive, it is clear that the intention was to terrorise a section of the people and it is not a case that the accused appellants wanted to exercise their right of private defence for themselves. The real object and the motive were to use it for spreading communal disharmony under the cover of self-protection and to terrorise people. So far as the confession in terms of Section 164 of the Code is concerned, it was submitted that the statements were recorded after making the confessors aware that they may be utilized in evidence against them. The so-called retraction was afterthought. The mere fact that the witnesses were examined after two days does not per se render their evidence suspect. It has to be noted that there was total chaos after the explosions. Everywhere bodies were lying scattered. There was no information as to how many were buried under the debris. The first attempt was to save lives of people rendering immediate medical assistance. At that point of time, recording of evidence was not the first priority. In fact, after the special team was constituted, the process of recording statements was started on 18.3.1993 and on that date the statements of material witnesses were recorded. With reference of Section 15 of the TADA Act, it is submitted that though the statements recorded the Magistrate was not strictly in line with Section 15 of the TADA Act, yet it deserves a greater degree of acceptability under the said Act. It cannot be conceived that the confession recorded by a Police Officer would stand on a better footing than one recorded by the Judicial Magistrate. Further, it was submitted that the confessional statements recorded clearly come within the ambit of Section 10 of the Evidence Act and, therefore, no further corroboration was necessary and to that extent Section 30 may not be applicable. Even otherwise, according to him, there was ample material to connect the accused appellants with the crime and the confessional statements were the last straw.

9. Responding to the plea that Section 3 of the Explosive Act had no application, it was submitted that the possession of the explosives has been established; the purpose for which they were stored and the bombs were manufactured has been established. Even if theoretically it is accepted that the accused appellants did not cause the explosion, but the others did at their behest, their constructive liability cannot be wiped out. They were the perpetrators of the crime being the brain behind it. Even if, for the sake of arguments it is accepted that the final touch was given by somebody else, may be the deceased accused persons, as they were the brains behind the whole show, their liability cannot be ignored and ruled out. In any event, according to him they have been charged with Section 3 of the Explosive Act and could be convicted under Section 4 of the said Act because the latter constitutes a lesser offence.

10. By ways of rejoinder, it was submitted by learned counsel for the-accused-appellants that Section 10 of the Evidence Act has no application, because after the act flowing from the conspiracy is over, the relevance of any statement in relation to the conspiracy is of no consequence. After the explosion, even if the same was the result of conspiracy as alleged, any confessional statement recorded under Section 164 of the Code cannot come within the ambit of Section 10 of the Evidence Act.

11. First, we shall deal with the plea regarding acceptability of the evidence. It is to be seen as to what is the evidence of PWs 40, 67 and 68 and how they establish prosecution case. PW-40 had deposed about presence of Murtaza Bhai, Gulzar Bhai, Khalid Bhai, Ukil Tenia, Khursid and Hansu while they were coming inside Satta Gali carrying two loaded gunny bags. Thereafter, they went upstairs of 267 B.B. Ganguly Street, PW-40 followed them up. He noticed the aforesaid persons mixing the ingredients of bombs and also manufacturing bombs. He found two drums, few gunny bags and small containers lying there. Murtaza, Gulzar and Khalid Were shifting and straining the explosive materials after taking it and from the gunny bags. His nose and eyes got irritated when the process was going on. therefore, he came down. Around 10 to 10.30 p.m. he saw Rashid, Aziz Zakrin and Lalu coming inside the Satta Gali with an old man wearing spectacles (identified as accused-appellant Pannalal Jaysoara). While moving up the stairs to the upper floor, Rashid asked the oldman to prepare bombs with the materials brought by him. Criticism was leveled by learned counsel for accused-appellant that the entire conversation alleged to have taken place was disclosed by PW-40 during investigation. On verification of records, it appears that though the exact words of the conversation were not stated, in substance the same idea was conveyed. PWs 67 and 68 have stated about plan of and preparation for manufacture of bombs. Their statement was to the effect that on 16.3.1993 at about 11.00 p.m. they went to meet Rashid Khan to ventilate their grievance against some of the painkillers disturbing the tranquility of the locality. PW-67 has deposed that Rashid was standing alone in front of the Satta office. As he and PW-68 were reporting the matter to Rashid, an old man wearing spectacles (identified as accused Pannalal Jaysoara) and Osman came out of Satta gali. The old man reported to Rashid that it would take whole night to prepare bombs by using the mixture. On being asked as to what would be done with the bombs, Rashid replied that large number of bombs were required because of the riot at Bombay between Hindus and Muslims. Statement of PW-68 is to the Similar effect that on 16.3.1993 around 11.00 p.m. accused-appellant Rashid intimated an old man (identified as accused-appellant Pannalal Jaysoara) that preparation of large number of bombs was required to be used in the event Hindus attacked the Muslims, and it was necessary in view of riots in Bombay. PWs 67 and 68 belonged to the locality and were acquainted with Rashid Khan. Their near relatives were staying in the locality. It is on record that some relatives of PW-68 have lost their lives in the incident. Confidential statement of accused-appellant, Pannalal Jaysoara was to the effect that he had asked accused-appellant Rashid as to the urgency for preparing large number of bombs. His reply was that he took the decision of preparing bombs so that Muslims could fight in the possible riot. In the test identification parade PWs 40, 67 and 68 identified accused-appellant Pannalal Jaysoara on 15.4.1993. Confessional statement of accused-appellant Gulzar is relevant. He stated that Rashid had reminded them that many Muslims had been killed in the riot at Bombay and Government did not do anything for the Muslims. If there is a riot, many Muslims may die as the Government may not do anything. therefore, he took the decision of preparing large quantity of explosives and bombs. PW 67 has deposed that accused-appellant Rashid directed preparation of large number of bombs overnight. Presence of the accused persons in and around the place of occurrence has been amply established by the evidence of PWs 40, 67 and 68, as well the confessional statements of Pannalal and Gulzar.

12. In the case at hand, the evidence of PWs. 40, 67 and 68 even after the close scrutiny cannot be termed to be unreliable. Merely because they were the persons with no fixed avocation, the very fact that they were regular visitors to the place of occurrence described as 'Satta Gali', makes their presence nothing but natural. Additionally, we find that relatives of PW-68 have lost lives. Mere delay in examination of the witnesses for a few days cannot in all cases be termed to be fatal so far as the prosecution is concerned. There may be several reasons. When the delay is explained, whatever be the length of the delay, the Court can act on the testimony of the witness if it is found to be cogent and credible. In the case at hand, as has been rightly pointed out by the learned counsel for the respondents, the first priority was rendering assistance to those who had suffered injuries and were lying under the debris of the demolished buildings. The magnitude of the incident can be well judged from the fact that a total building collapsed and two other buildings were demolished to a substantial extent, 69 persons lost their lives and large number of persons were injured. therefore, statement of PW-68 that he was busy in attending to the injured and collecting dead bodies till 18.3.1993 cannot be said to be improbable. Though, an attempt has been made to show that there is no truth in his statement that he had carried the injured persons to the hospital by making reference to certain noting in the medical reports to the effect that unknown persons brought the injured to the hospital, that is really of no consequence. When large number of persons were being brought to the hospital, the foremost duty of the doctors and other members of the staff was to provide immediate treatment, and not to go about collecting information as to who had brought the injured to the hospital for treatment. That would be contrary to the normal human conduct. Looked at from any angle, the evidence of PWs. 40, 67 and 68 cannot be said to be suffering from any infirmity. Their statements along with the confessional statements of the co-accused lend a definite assurance to the prosecution version.

13. Next comes the accused- appellants' plea relating to non-examination of witnesses.

14. Normally, the prosecution's duty is to examine all the eyewitnesses selection of whom has to be made with due care, honestly and fairly. The witnesses have to be selected with a view not to suppress any honest opinion, and due care has to be taken that in selection of witnesses, no adverse inference is drawn against the prosecution. However, no general rule can be laid down that each and every witness has to be examined even though his testimony may or may not be material. The most important factor for the prosecution being that all those witnesses strengthening the case of the prosecution have to be examined, the prosecution can pick and choose the witnesses who are considered to be relevant and material for the purpose of unfolding the case of the prosecution. It is not the quantity but the quality of the evidence that is important. In the case at hand, if the prosecution felt that its case has been well established through the witnesses examined, it cannot be said that non-examination of some persons rendered its version vulnerable.

15. As was observed by this Court in Habeeb Mohammad v. State of Hyderabad MANU/SC/0034/1953MANU/SC/0034/1953 : [1954]1SCR475 prosecution is not bound to call a witness about whom there is a reasonable ground for believing that he will not speak the truth.

16. It has not been shown as to how the examination of persons like Nausad and Osman would have thrown any light on the issues involved. Whether Usman was the owner of the house or not has no significance when the prosecution has established the conspiracy angle and preparation of bombs by credible evidence. Similarly, Osman was the person to whom one witness is stated to have told about the conspiracy angle. Since that witness has been held to be reliable, non-examination of Osman is really of no consequence. A reference was made to some persons who were parties to the Test Identification Parade. It is pointed out that some of them did not identify all the accused persons. Here again, the non-examination of these persons cannot be held to be of any consequence. Those persons who have identified the accused persons knew them earlier. therefore, even if some persons not examined did not identify all the accused persons that does not in any way affect the credibility of the witnesses who knew them, have identified them and deposed about the conspiracy and the preparation of bombs. Above being the position, no adverse inference can be drawn.

17. It would be appropriate to deal with the question of conspiracy. Section 120B of IPC is the provision which provides for punishment for criminal conspiracy. Definition of 'criminal conspiracy' given in Section 120A reads as follows:

""120A- When two or more persons agree to do, or cause to be done,-

(1) an illegal act, or

(2) an act which is not illegal by illegal means, such an agreement is designated a criminal conspiracy;

Provided that no agreement except an agreement to commit an offence shall amount to a criminal conspiracy unless some act besides the agreement is done by one or more parties to such agreement in pursuance thereof.

The elements of a criminal conspiracy have been stated to be: (a) an object to be accomplished, (b) a plan or scheme embodying means to accomplish that object, (c) an agreement or understanding between two or more of the accused persons whereby, they become definitely committed to co-operate for the accomplishment of the object by the means embodied in the agreement, or by any effectual means, (d) in the jurisdiction where the statute required an overt act. The essence of a criminal conspiracy is the unlawful combination and ordinarily the offence is complete when the combination is framed. From this, it necessarily follows that unless the statute so requires, no overt act need be done in furtherance of the conspiracy, and that the object of the combination need not be accomplished, in order to constitute an indictable offence. Law making conspiracy a crime, is designed to curb immoderate power to do mischief which is gained by a combination of the means. The encouragement and support which co-conspirators give to one another rendering enterprises possible which, if left to individual effort, would have been impossible, furnish the ground for visiting conspirators and abettors with condign punishment. The conspiracy is held to be continued and renewed as to all its members wherever and whenever any member of the conspiracy acts in furtherance of the common design. (See: American Jurisprudence Vol. II See 23, p. 559). For an offence punishable under Section 120-B, prosecution need not necessarily prove that the perpetrators expressly agree to do or cause to be done illegal act; the agreement may be proved by necessary implication. Offence of criminal conspiracy has its foundation in an agreement to commit an offence. A conspiracy consists not merely in the intention of two or more, but in the agreement of two or more to do an unlawful act by unlawful means. So long as such a design rests in intention only, it is not indictable. When two agree to carry into effect, the very plot is an act in itself, and an act of each of the parties, promise against promise, actus contra actum, capable of being enforced, if lawful, punishable if for a criminal object or for use of criminal means.

18. No doubt in the case of conspiracy there cannot be any direct evidence. The ingredients of offence are that there should be an agreement between persons who are alleged to conspire and the said agreements should be for doing an illegal act or for doing illegal means an act which itself may not be illegal. therefore, the essence of criminal conspiracy is an agreement to do an illegal act and such an agreement can be proved either by direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence or by both, and it is a matter of common experience that direct evidence to prove conspiracy is rarely available. therefore, the circumstances proved before, during and after the occurrence have to be considered to decide about the complicity of the accused.

19. In Halsbury's Laws of England (vide 4th Ed. Vol. 11, page 44, page 58), the English Law as to conspiracy has been stated thus:

""Conspiracy consists in the agreement of two or more persons to do an unlawful act, or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. It is an indictable offence of common law, the punishment for which is imprisonment or fine or both in the discretion of the Court. The essence of the offence of conspiracy is the fact of combination by agreement. The agreement may be express or implied, or in part express and in part implied. The conspiracy arises and the offence is committed as soon as the agreement is made; and the offence continues to be committed so long as the combination persists, that is until the conspiratorial agreement is terminated by completion of its performance or by abandonment or frustration or however, it may be. The actus rues in a conspiracy is the agreement to execute the illegal conduct, not the execution of it. It is not enough that two or more persons pursued the same unlawful object at the same time or in the same place; it is necessary to show a meeting of minds, a consensus to effect an unlawful purpose. It is not, however, necessary that each conspirator should have been communication with every other.""

20. There is no difference between the mode of proof of the offence of conspiracy and that of any other offence, it can be established by direct or circumstantial evidence. (See: Bhagwan Swamp Lal Bishan Lal etc. etc. v. State of Maharashtra AIR 1965 SC 682 .

21. Privacy and secrecy are more characteristics of a conspiracy, than of a loud discussion in an elevated place open to public view. Direct evidence in proof of a conspiracy is seldom available, offence of conspiracy can be proved by either direct or circumstantial evidence. It is not always possible to give affirmative evidence about the date of the formation of the criminal conspiracy, about the persons who took part in the formation of the conspiracy, about the object, with the objectors set before themselves as the object of conspiracy, and about the manner in which the object of conspiracy is to be carried out, all this is necessarily a matter of inference.

22. The provisions of Section 120-A and 120-B, IPC have brought the law of conspiracy in India in line with the English Law by making the overt act unessential when the conspiracy is to commit any punishable offence. The English Law on this matter is well settled. Russell on crime (12 Ed. Vol. I, p. 202) may be usefully noted-

The gist of the offence of conspiracy then lies, not in doing the act, or effecting the purpose for which the conspiracy is formed, nor in attempting to do them, nor in inciting others to do them, but in the forming of the scheme or agreement between the parties, agreement is essential. Mere knowledge, or even discussion, of the plan is not, per se, enough.""

23. Glanville Williams in the ""Criminal Law"" (Second Ed. P. 382) states-

""The question arose in an Iowa case, but it was discussed in terms of conspiracy rather than of accessoryship. D, who had a grievance against P, told E that if he would whip P someone would pay his fine. E replied that he did not want anyone to pay his fine, that he had a grievance of his own against P and that he would whip him at the first opportunity. E whipped P. D was acquitted of conspiracy because there was no agreement for 'concert of action', no agreement to ""co-operate'.

Coleridge, J. while summing up the case to Jury in Regina v. Murphy 1837 173 ER 502 states:

""I am bound to tell you, that although the common design is the root of the charge, it is not necessary to prove that these two parties came together and actually agreed in terms to have this common design and to pursue it by common means, and so to carry it into execution. This is not necessary, because in many cases of the most clearly established conspiracies there are no means of proving any such thing and neither law nor common sense requires that it should be proved. If you find that these two persons pursued by their acts the same object, often by the same means, one performing one part of an act, so as to complete it, with a view to the attainment of the object which they were pursuing, you will be at liberty to draw the conclusion that they have been engaged in a conspiracy to effect that object. The question you have to ask yourselves is, had they this common design, and did they pursue it by these common means the design being unlawful.""

24. As noted above, the essential ingredient of the offence of criminal conspiracy is the agreement to commit an offence. In a case where the agreement is for accomplishment of an act which by "

1. Leave granted.

2. The General Election to Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly took place in 2013. The Appellant herein is one of the contesting candidates for 72-Kawardha Legislative Assembly Constituency.

3. Polling took place on 19.11.2013. The result was declared on 8.12.2013. First Respondent was declared elected. The Appellant secured the second highest number of votes in the said election. On 20.1.2014, the Appellant filed Election Petition No. 4 of 2014 challenging the election of the first Respondent on various grounds including the commission of certain corrupt practices. On 29.1.2014, the High Court issued summons to the Respondents.

4. It appears that matter was listed on 25.3.2014. It is not very clear from the records whether all the Respondents were served or not. But from copy of the order dated 25.3.2014, it appears that only Respondent Nos. 1, 5, 9 and 10 were represented by counsel and other Respondents were not represented. The High Court recorded an order as follows:

There is an oral prayer made for extension of time for filing written statement but there is no application is writing in that regard.

In the interest of justice, three days time is granted to learned Counsel for the Respondent to file application if any.

5. On 26.3.2014, the first Respondent herein filed two applications-one invoking Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (for short ""Code of Civil Procedure"") and another raising certain preliminary objections to the maintainability of the election petition.

6. On 2.4.2014, two more interlocutory applications came to be filed, one each at the instance of Respondent No. 1 and 10 seeking extension of time for filing the written statement. The said applications were allowed and the High Court granted another 30 days' time for filing the written statement.

7. Thereafter the matter underwent number of adjournments, the details of which may not be necessary for the purpose of this order. Eventually, arguments on Order VII Rule 11 Code of Civil Procedure were heard in part on 27.6.2014. After two more adjournments, on 1.7.2014 arguments on the said applications were concluded and the matter was fixed for orders on 21.7.2014. However, the order was not pronounced and the matter was again adjourned for 30.7.2014 on which date the interlocutory applications filed by the Respondents were dismissed.

8. On 14.8.2014, appearance was entered on behalf of Respondent No. 8 by one Shri Ashish Shrivastav, who is none other than the brother of Justice Manindra M. Srivastava who was the Judge hearing the Election Petition. Justice Manindra Srivastava promptly recused from the election petition and in our opinion rightly. On such recusal, the election petition was allotted to another learned Judge.

9. In the meanwhile on 26.8.2014, a complaint regarding the appearance by the above-mentioned Ashish Srivastav was made to the Hon'ble Chief Justice. The election petition was further adjourned.

10. It appears that Respondent No. 8 filed another application under Order VII Rule 11 of Code of Civil Procedure. But, the counsel for Respondent No. 8, Shri Ashish Srivastava filed an application seeking permission to withdraw his Vakalatnama. The said application was allowed by the High Court. On 28.11.2014, a Vakalatnama came to be filed by Shri B.P. Gupta on behalf of the Respondent No. 1 though there is another counsel on record already. It appears that at the instance of Shri B.P. Gupta, the matter was once again adjourned ostensibly to enable Shri B.P. Gupta to get ready with the case. On 4.12.2014, the application filed by the Respondent No. 8 under Order VII Rule 11 came to be dismissed.

11. Broadly, it is in the above-mentioned background the instant SLP came to be filed complaining that notwithstanding the mandate of Section 86, Sub-section (7) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, the High Court has not disposed of the election petition so far. Section 86, Sub-section (7) reads as follows:

Section 86(7)-Every election petition shall be tried as expeditiously as possible and endeavour shall be made to conclude the trial within six months from the date on which the election petition is presented to the High Court for trial.

12. It was the pious hope of the Parliament that election disputes under the Representation of the People Act, 1951 should be resolved expeditiously. The purpose is obvious. The tenure of the members of the Parliament as well as the Legislature of the State is relatively short. It is five years in the case of Lok Sabha and Legislative Assembly, and six years in the case of Rajya Sabha and Legislative Council. Therefore, if there is a dispute regarding the election of any member of any one of the said bodies, it is desirable that the dispute is resolved as early as possible for various reasons.

(i) Membership of the Legislative bodies under the scheme of our constitution is a sacred responsibility. The continuance of any member in such bodies who secured his election to such a body by legally impermissible means even for a day is most undesirable. Such continuance affords an opportunity to such a member to take part in the law making process affecting the destinies of the people.

(ii) Even from the point of view of the contesting candidates, unless the rights and the obligations are decided within a reasonable time, the adjudication and the consequences of the adjudication may eventually remain on paper without any tangible effect insofar as the participation of such parties in the legislative process.

13. However, we are sad to state that invariably the resolution of election disputes in this country takes unacceptably long periods in most of the cases. Very rarely an election dispute gets resolved during the tenure of the declared candidate reducing the adjudicatory process into a mockery of justice. Such delay coupled with a right of appeal to this Court makes the whole process of adjudication a task in a good number of cases. The reasons are many, we will only mention few;

(i) The stakes are very high for the parties. Nothing short of the membership of a constitutional body for a limited period. The power and glory that go with such membership is too high and valuable and the returned candidates naturally leave no stone unturned for protracting the litigation as long as possible.

(ii) The law of elections and election disputes is highly technical. Therefore, there is always scope for lot of objections and cross-objections regarding every step in the conduct of the election petition.

(iii) The absence of dedicated Benches in the High Court for resolution of the election disputes is another factor which contributes enormously to the delay in the adjudicatory process.

14. We therefore deem it desirable that in each High Court dedicated Benches are created by the Chief Justice to deal with the election petitions exclusively. In other words, those judges assigned with the adjudication of election petitions preferably may not be burdened with any other work until the adjudication of the election petitions is completed. An exercise which may not be difficult especially the class of litigation occurs only once in 5 or 6 years and the number of cases would be very limited. We are conscious of the fact that it is not possible for laying down any absolute rules in this regard. Essentially it is for a Chief Justice of the High Court to run the administration and devise ways and means for expeditiously disposing of the cases brought before the High Court. We only gently remind that the kind of delay in the adjudication of election disputes exposes the High Court's unpleasant criticism damaging the credibility of the institution. A situation which is certainly required to be avoided at any cost.

15. The facts of the present case are telling. Some 15 months after the election, the trial of the election petition has not yet commenced. In the circumstances, we deem it appropriate to request the Chief Justice to take necessary steps for disposal of the Election Petition No. 4 of 2014 expeditiously, by devising such appropriate measures as the Hon'ble Chief Justice may deem fit and proper in the circumstances.

16. We also place on record our disapproval of the tactics adopted by the Respondents in engaging counsel whose appearance is bound to embarrass the presiding Judge and we feel sad for the noble profession, some of whose members are willing to take part in such unwholesome practices.

17. Appeals are accordingly disposed of.

S.B. Sinha, J.

1. Whether settlement of a private dispute between the parties to a writ proceeding is permissible in law, is the prime question involved in these batch of appeals which arise out of judgments and orders passed by Madhya Pradesh High Court in M.P. No. 802 of 1992 and M.C.C. No. 477 of 1992 and the connected writ petition.

The factual matrix involved in these matters may be noticed in brief.

2. A partnership firm known as M/s. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal & Brothers (The firm) was constituted with Dwarka Prasad Agarwal (since deceased), Bishambhar Dayal Agarwal (since deceased), Mahesh Prasad Aggarwal - all sons of Keshav Dev Agarwal and Ramesh Chandra Agarwal, son of Dwarka Prasad Agarwal in the year 1972 as a partners thereof. Each partner contributed towards the capital of the Firm in share to the extent of 25%, 30%, 30% and 15% respectively. Prior to the constitution of the Firm, a newspaper known as 'Dainik Bhaskar' was being published by Dwarka Prasad Agarwal and his name was recorded in the Registrar of Newspapers for India (for short 'RNI'). The said Dwarka Prasad Agarwal was the karta of a larger HUF consisting of himself and his partners. He had two wives, namely, Kasturidevi and Kishoridevi. Allegedly, the firm transferred the business of publication of Dainik Bhaskar at Gwalior to a newly incorporated company, M/s. Bhaskar Publication and Allied Industries Pvt. Ltd. of which Dwarka Prasad Agarwal was the lifetime Managing Director and Chairman and therein Bishambhar Dayal Agarwal and his son, Ramesh Chandra Agarwal were shareholders and directors. A printing press of which Dwarka Prasad Agarwal was the owner is said to have been transferred to the said company for the purpose of printing of the aforementioned newspaper. According to the appellants, in the Annual Reports of the RNI, the name of the said firm was shown as the owner of the said newspaper. It is not disputed that in the year 1982, Dwarka Prasad Agarwal suffered from a paralytic attack and was unable to attend to business actively.

3. It is alleged that Ramesh Chandra Agarwal filed a Declaration on or about 13.10.84 along with an authority letter dated 10.1.83 from Dwarka Prasad Agarwal in respect of publication of Dainik Bhaskar at Indore for admitting him to be the owner of the newspaper and the company as a lessee. Certain documents were allegedly created on 13th March, 1985 by Ramesh Chandra Agarwal for the said purpose; one of them, being an Agreement of Sale alleged to have been entered by and between the Firm and a company called M/s. Writers & Publishers Pvt. Ltd., the genuineness or otherwise of which was the subject matter of a suit being suit No. 57A of 1988. Another document also came to be executed on the same day, the genuineness whereof was also disputed, is an alleged deed of partition/family settlement of the HUF; in terms whereof the firm's assets, several other properties, fixed deposits, money and business including those situated at Bombay, Delhi, Raipur, Indore, were divided between Dwarka Prasad Agarwal, Bishambhar Dayal Agarwal, Mahesh Prasad Agarwal and Ramesh Chandra Agarwal. According to the appellant, Dwarka Prasad Agarwal never signed the said deed of partition/family settlement not was it acted upon and in fact was questioned as forged and non-existent by Bishambhar Dayal Agarwal in a proceeding before District Magistrate, Jabalpur and the same was also the subject matter of suit No. 57A of 1988 pending in the court of District Judge, Bhopal. Several other suits were filed by the parties at several places viz. Jabalpur, Bhopal, Raipur, Gwalior, etc. Several proceedings were also initiated before different forums with regard to publication of the said newspapers at different places. Some writ petitions were also filed by the parties before the High Court. Some proceedings by way of Special Leave Application were also filed before this Court.

4. It may not be necessary to delve deep into the effect and purport of the said disputes for answering the issue involved in these matters, except a few.

5. It may, however, be noticed that Bishambhar Dayal Agarwal, questioning the authentication made by the Additional District Magistrate, Jabalpur of the Declaration filed by Sudhir Agarwal, son of Ramesh Chandra Agarwal for newspaper 'Nav Bhaskar' as regard its publication from Jabalpur as also a purported order passed thereupon by the said authority on 3.12.91 filed a writ petition before the Madhya Pradesh High Court. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal was made a proforma respondent herein. The said writ petition was marked as MP No. 802 of 1992 wherein the following reliefs were claimed:

""(i) That the Hon'ble Court be pleased to declare by an appropriate writ, order or direction that the power conferred on the District Magistrate/Additional District Magistrate under Section 4 and 6 of the Press and Registration of Books Act, 1867, in case of declarations submitted for same or similar titles as ultra vires to the petitioner's right under Article 14, 19(1)(a) and (g) of the Constitution of India.

(ii) That the Hon'ble Court be further pleased to declare by an appropriate writ that if a power is conferred on District Magistrate/Additional District Magistrate to grant declaration of title of same or similar nature, such a power cannot be exercised by the District Magistrate/Additional District Magistrate till an Appellate Authority is constituted to be able to oversee and review the exercise of powers by the District Magistrate/Additional District Magistrate. The non-provision of Appellate power violates the petitioner's fundamental rights under Article 14 and 19(1)(a) and (g) of the Constitution of India.

(iii) That the Hon'ble Court be further pleased to quash and set aside the declaration dated 11.10.1991 approved by the Additional District Magistrate, Jabalpur, of the title Nav Bhaskar submitted by publisher Sudhir Agarwal as void, illegal and contrary to law.

(iii-a) The Hon'ble High Court may be pleased to quash and set aside the declaration dated 14.2.1992 Annexure P.27 authenticated by the Additional District Magistrate, Jabalpur in favour of the respondent No. 1 Sudhir Agarwal for printing and publishing newspaper under the name and style of Nav Bhaskar as void, illegal and non-set in law.

(iv) That the Hon'ble Court be further pleased to set aside and quash the order dated 3.12.1991 passed by the Additional District Magistrate, Jabalpur, on an application/objection made by the petitioner under Section 8-B of the Press and Registration of Books Act, 1867 as void, illegal and contrary to law.

(v) That the Hon'ble Court may be further pleased to prohibit and restrain the respondent Sudhir Agarwal and his father Shri Ramesh Chandra Agarwal from using the title Nav Bhaskar and to restrain the A.D.M. Jabalpur from granting any such or similar title to Shri Sudhir Agarwal or Shri Ramesh Chandra Agarwal.

(vi) Any other appropriate writ, order or direction which the Hon'ble Court deems just and proper may also be passed in the facts and circumstances of the case as also in the interest of justice.

(vii) Cost of proceedings of this petition may also be awarded in favour of the petitioner.""

6. During pendency of the said writ proceedings, on 29.6.92 the petitioner therein, Ramesh Chandra Agarwal son of Dwarka Prasad Agarwal and Mahesh Prasad Agarwal along with their sons Kailash, Sudhir and Sanjay purported to have entered into a deed of settlement. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal admittedly was a proforma respondent therein and although his rights as partner were directly affected thereby he was neither a party to the said settlement nor a signatory to the said deed. The said purported agreement was filed on the same day before the Madhya Pradesh High Court by the petitioner therein alleging that he and the contesting respondents had reached a full and final settlement of 'the disputes raised in the petition and other connected matters' pending before various courts and bodies and the writ petition be disposed of in terms of the said purported comprehensive agreement. The said settlement was accepted and the writ petition was disposed of in terms thereof on 29.6.1992 which was also the date of filing of the compromise memo. The said order dated 29.6.92 is the subject matter of civil Appeal No. 4782 of 1996.

7. Pursuant to or in furtherance of the said purported compromise, RNI altered the name of owner of title Dainik Bhaskar in his Register from the Firm to M/s. Writers on or about 3.9.1992 stating:

""This is to state that in accordance with the notice issued on the above subject in the matter of ownership of Dainik Bhaskar, as per the decision in Case No. 1182/92 dated 29.6.92 of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, at Jabalpur and agreement dated 19.6.92 M/s. Writer & Publishers Pvt. Ltd., Bhopal, has become the owner of Dainik Bhaskar.

You are, therefore, requested that if you have any objection to this decision then you may approach the High Court at Jabalpur.""

8. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal having come to learn the said order of RNI dated 3.9.1992 filed an application for review of the order dated 29.6.1992 passed by the High Court which was marked as MCC No. 477 of 1992. The said review petition was dismissed by an order dated 13.11.1992 and the same is the subject matter of civil Appeal No. 4783 of 1996.

9. The High Court in its order dated 13.11.92 refusing to review its earlier order dated 3.9.92 inter alia held:

(i) The agreement in question is a lawful one.

(ii) As Dwarka Prasad Agarwal was not a signatory thereto, he was not bound thereby.

(iii) The order recording compromise was legal as no other party including the learned advocate of Dwarka Prasad Agarwal objected thereto.

(iv) No writ was issued by the High Court in terms of the said order against the Additional District Magistrate, Jabalpur or any other authority.

10. Pursuant to or in furtherance of the said order dated 29.6.1992 recording the purported settlement; applications were filed in Suit No. 74A of 1987 and 75A of 1987 in Bhopal by M/s. Writers and Ramesh Chandra Agarwal for withdrawal thereof, whereupon the suits were dismissed. Bishambhar Dayal Agarwal also, who had filed suit No. 57A of 1988, moved an application to the effect that pursuant to the compromise the suit be dismissed. This plea was also accepted.

11. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal filed Writ Petition No. 527 of 1993 in this Court questioning the aforementioned order dated 3.9.92 passed by RNI wherein inter alia the following reliefs were prayed for:

""(a) issue writ, order or direction quashing the order dated 3rd September, 1992 whereby the Registrar, Newspapers has changed the name of the owner of the title Dainik Bhaskar from M/s. D.P. Agarwal and Brothers to M/s. Writers and Publishers Private Limited;

(b) issue writ, order or direction directing Respondent No. 1 and 2 not to allow Respondent No. 7 to use the title Dainik Bhaskar for its publication;

(c) issue writ, order or direction directing the Respondents not to publish newspaper Dainik Bhaskar under the alleged title of Respondent No. 7;

(d) issue writ, order or direction directing the Respondent No. 2 to exercise its authority not to allow Respondents No. 3 to 7 to publish newspaper Dainik Bhaskar under the title of writers and publishers Private Limited;

(e) issue writ, order or direction directing the Respondent No. 8 not to allow the Respondents No. 3 to 7 to publish newspaper Dainik Bhaskar in contravention of the provisions of the Press and Registration of Books Act, 1867; and

(f) pass such other and further orders as may be deemed fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case.""

12. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal died during the pendency of these proceedings.

13. Both the wives of the said Dwarka Prasad Agarwal applied for substitution of their names in place of the deceased. The rival contentions on substitution by the two wives of Late Dwarka Prasad Agarwal came to be considered by this Court. Kishori Devi pressed her application. Kasturi Devi, however, was not sure that, she, having regard to her stand taken in the litigation, would be able to defend the action on behalf of her husband. Upon consideration of the said question, this Court directed Kasturi Devi to be impleaded as a respondent in the proceeding whereas Kishori Devi and her daughters Hemlata and Anuradha were directed to be substituted in place of Late Dwarka Prasad Agarwal. While passing the said order, however, an observation was made that the said question shall be finally decided at the time of hearing. We may, however notice that in the said proceedings for substitution, Ramesh Chandra Agarwal filed a counter affidavit calling Smt. Kishori Devi a concubine of Dwarka Prasad Agarwal. Keeping in view the stand taken by the parties before us we have no hesitation in holding that this Court rightly substitute Kishori Devi and her daughters Hemlata and Anuradha in place of Late Dwarka Prasad Agarwal.

14. Mr. Sunil Gupta, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants, as also the writ petitioner would submit that the impugned orders passed by the High Court are ex facie bad, illegal as by reason thereof the right title interest of Late Dwarka Prasad Agarwal, as specified hereunder, were directly and adversely affected although he was not a party or signatory to the said agreement.

(i) By reason of the said purported compromise, the firm was sought to be dissolved of which Dwarka Prasad Agarwal was a partner.

(ii) The firm's assets were to be sold as per the alleged agreement dated 13.3.85 and divided as per alleged partition deed of 13.4.85 which had not been signed and accepted by Dwarka Parsad Agarwal, karta of HUF and the genuineness whereof was also the subject matter of dispute.

(iii) The properties of the aforementioned firm, including the goodwill and ownership of Dainik Bhaskar over different territories were distributed by M/s. Writers Ltd. floated by Ramesh Chandra Agarwal amongst the three partners, namely, Ramesh Chandra Agarwal, Bishambhar Dayal Agarwal and Mahesh Chand Agarwal to the exclusion of Dwarka Prasad Agarwal, the 4th and the remaining partner.

(iv) Although several suits, namely Suit No. 74A of 1987, 75A of 1987, 57A of 1988, 22A of 1988, 99A of 1991 and Writ Petition, MP No. 802 of 1992 were filed by the parties, the disputes involved therein were sought to be resolved thereby which was impermissible in law.

15. The learned counsel would contend that the High court committed a serious error insofar as it failed to notice that Dwarka Prasad Agarwal could not have any knowledge of the said unjust agreement, whence the same was accepted. Although he had not instructed any lawyer to appear on his behalf and merely one blank Vakalatnama executed by him bona fide was used therefore, and thus, there was no question of his taking part in the proceeding for acceptance of the purported settlement. In any event as his lawyer admittedly recorded merely 'no instructions' in the said proceeding, the same could not have been treated as a consent/no objection to the recording of the compromise on his behalf and in that view of the matter the observations made by the High Court that the agreement was not opposed on behalf of the parties must held to be per se unreasonable and unjustified.

16. Our attention, in this regard, has been drawn to various disputed factual aspects of the matter for the purpose of showing that several mis-representation of fact had been made in the aforementioned agreement of settlement and the application dated 29.6.92 filed for recording the compromise before the High Court.

17. The learned counsel would further contended that the compromise was, in any event, not lawful as thereby right of ownership of an existing title in newspaper was sought to be determined in violation of Section 19B, the proviso appended to Section 6 and Section 8B(ii) of the Press and Registration of Books Act, 1867 as in terms thereof the authorities were under a statutory obligation to preserve and protect the right of the firm as regard ownership of title Dainik Bhaskar and to prevent any person from using the same without the authorization of the firm.

18. The goodwill of a firm, the learned counsel would urge, would also be a subject matter of division of assets of partnership firm irrespective of the fact as to whether the firm had thence been carrying on business or not. Furthermore, as by reason of the said compromise, transfers were sought to be made without registering the same in terms of Indian Registration Act, the same was illegal. It was further submitted that impact of the impugned order can be noticed from the fact that by reason of the said purported consent order dated 29.6.92, even the RNI also found himself compelled to forgo his statutory obligation and found itself to be bound to alter the name of the owner of the title in the register maintained by the said authority in terms of Section 19B of the Act from M/s D.P. Agarwal & Bros. to M/s Writers & Publishers Pvt. Ltd. Recording of the said compromise, it was urged, must be held to amount to practising of fraud on the court by the parties to the agreement, as thereby they had achieved their purpose indirectly which law prohibits them achieving directly and furthermore, as a large number of proceedings in relation to the disputes amongst the parties were pending before different forums, they could not have been given a go bye by reason thereof.

19. The learned counsel would contend that public law remedy by way of a writ petition could not have been taken recourse to for resolution of a private dispute. It was submitted that in that view of the matter, the observations of the High Court that its order did not amount to issuance of a writ by the Court against any of the parties must be held to be illegal and without jurisdiction.

20. Drawing our attention to the applications for withdrawal of the suits in terms of the said compromise petition, the learned counsel would submit that the order accepting the compromise was misused inasmuch as the said suits were purported to have been withdrawn on the ground that the same was a necessary fallout of the judgment of the judgment of the High Court, which in effect and substance, it was not.

21. On the writ petition filed by Late Dwarka Prasad Agarwal under Article 32 of the Constitution of India in this Court, the learned counsel would submit that having regard to the fact that the official respondents had changed the entries in the register maintained under the Act is a clear pointer to show as to how the order of high Court was misunderstood by the statutory authorities. It was submitted that in terms of the provisions of the Press and Registration of Books Act, 1867, late Dwarka Prasad Agarwal had acquired various rights coupled with the common law right as a partner of the partnership firm which could not have been taken away only with his consent or by operation of law. According to the learned counsel, in terms of the provisions of the said Act, it is one thing to say that somebody is the owner of the title in relation to the newspaper in question and it is another thing that somebody is the printer and publisher thereof.

22. As regard maintainability of the writ petition, Mr. Gupta vehemently urged that the cause of action therefore had arisen in view of illegal action on the part of the official respondents resulting from misuse of judicial process. He would urge that publication of a newspaper is a fundamental right in terms of Article 19(1) of the Constitution of India and as the action of the official respondents directly resulted in infringement of the right of the said writ petitioners. Reliance, in this connection, has been placed on Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0273/1985MANU/SC/0273/1985 : AIR1986SC872 and Jhumman Singh and Ors. v. Central Board of Investigation and Ors. MANU/SC/2019/1995MANU/SC/2019/1995 : [1995]3SCR95 .

23. Dr. A.M. Singhvi, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of respondent Sudhir Kumar Agarwal, on the other hand, would submit that as by reason of the order recording the settlement entered into by and between the parties thereto, by the High Court, the right of Dwarka Prasad Agarwal was not affected as he was not bound thereby and further in view of the fact that no writ was issued against the A.D.M. Jabalpur, the question of appellants' being prejudiced by reason of the impugned order would not arise. Drawing our attention to the order dated 13.11.1992 whereby and whereunder the High Court refused to review its order dated 29.6.1992, the learned counsel would contend that the correct legal position has been clarified by the High Court, Late Dwarka Prasad Agarwal could have taken recourse to appropriate legal proceeding to protect his own interest and, thus, the impugned orders need not be interfered with. As regard the writ petition filed by Shri Bishambhar Dayal Agarwal, Dr. Singhvi would contend that from a perusal thereof it would appear that main prayer against the A.D.M., Jabalpur, was dependent upon the authenticity of the declaration made by one of the respondents therein and in view of the fact that the parties had buried their private disputes, at least prayers (3) and (4) could be granted by the High Court, more so when prayers (1) and (2) thereof had not been pressed.

24. Dr. Singhvi would urge that having regard to the provisions contained in Section 5(5) of the said Act, the writ petition also became infructuous and, thus, there was no occasion for the High Court to issue any writ. Referring to certain documents, the learned counsel would argue that as prior to the filing of the writ petition, Dwarka prasad Agarwal had given up his own right in the newspaper and acknowledged the right of his respondents and the company; he had no locus standi to prefer appeals against the impugned orders of High Court or file the writ petition. As regard the effect of the consent order the learned counsel relied upon the decision of this Court in Salkia Businessman's Association and Ors. v. Howrah Municipal Corporation and Ors. MANU/SC/0432/2001MANU/SC/0432/2001 : AIR2001SC2790 .

25. Mr. P.P. Rao, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of Smt. Kasturi Devi, inter alia, would submit that the writ petition filed before this Court by Dwarka Prasad Agarwal (since deceased) was not maintainable. Mr. Rao, would contend that having regard to the prayers contained in Clause (1) and (2) thereof, there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that the writ petition before the High Court was maintainable and only because at a later stage the private dispute between the parties was resolved, the same by itself would not lead to a conclusion that the writ petition ceased to be so. Mr. Rao would submit that legality or otherwise of the said compromise cannot be held to have been questioned by Late Dwarka Prasad Agarwal as no illegality in relation thereto was pointed out by anybody.

26. Mr. Shanti Bhushan, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of Mahesh Agarwal, however, conceded that the order dated 29.6.1992 of the High Court based on compromise must be set aside and consequently prayer (a) in the writ petition may also be granted. However, according to the learned counsel the petitioner is not entitled to any other relief.

27. Several questions of importance, as noticed hereinbefore, have arisen for consideration in these appeals and the writ petition.

28. A writ petition is filed in public law remedy. The High Court while exercising a per of judicial review is concerned with illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety of an order passed by the State or a statutory authority. Remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution of India cannot be invoked for resolution of a private law dispute as contra distinguished from a dispute involving public law character. It is also well-settled that a writ remedy is not available from resolution of a property or a title dispute. Indisputably, a large number of private disputes between the parties and in particular the question as to whether any deed of transfer was effected in favour of M/s. Writer & Publishers Pvt. Ltd. as also whether a partition or a family settlement was arrived or not, were pending adjudication before the civil Courts of competent jurisdiction. The reliefs sought for in the writ petition primarily revolved round the order of authentication of the declaration made by one of the respondents in terms of the provisions of the said Act. The writ petition, in the factual matrix involved in the matter, could have been held to be maintainable only for that purpose and no other.

29. An agreement recording terms of settlement between the parties on their private dispute was executed on 29.6.1992. The application for disposal of the writ petition in terms of the said agreement as also the other of the High Court in M.P. No. 802 of 1992 was passed on the same day. The writ petition was not ready for hearing on the said date. Admittedly, Dwarka Prasad Agarwal was not a signatory to the said agreement. He was also not put on notice there-about. Assuming that he had engaged an Advocate, keeping in view the fact that he was a proforma respondent therein, the said learned Advocate was merely required to watch the proceedings as no relief had been claimed against him. The question of the learned advocate of Dwarka Prasad Agarwal not arising any objection as regard legality or otherwise of the said agreement dated 29.6.1992 neither directly nor indirectly arose for consideration before the High Court. He also did not make any submission as regard the lawfulness or otherwise of the said compromise. He merely stated that he had no instruction in the matter. In that view of the matter, it was obligatory on the part of the High Court to issue notice to Late Dwarka Prasad Agarwal in respect thereof or to allow sufficient time to the learned Advocate to obtain proper and adequate instructions.

30. In the aforementioned premise, the High Court was furthermore required to apply its own mind for the purpose of arriving at a finding as to whether it, in public law remedy, could record the compromise and dispose of the said writ petition in terms thereof. The order dated 29.6.1992 passed in M.P. No. 280 of 1992 was purported to have been clarified by the High Court in its order dated 13.11.1992 in the review petition being MCC No. 477 of 1977. The said order clearly demonstrates to total non-application of mind on the part of the High Court.

31. Several issues of grave importance were required to be addressed by the High Court. The High Court sought to take a short cut in holding that the said compromise was not binding upon Dwarka Prasad Agarwal and thereby no writ was issued. The consequence of recording of the said compromise was tell-tale. Not only pursuant thereto or in furtherance thereof the Registrar of Newspapers, New Delhi, passed an order dated 3.9.1992; it was construed to be a judgment of the High Court which had been taken aid of by the respondents herein for the purpose of withdrawal of suits wherein various disputed questions of facts and law including the genuineness or otherwise of the agreements were in question and required adjudication. The High Court was also required to address itself, more so while disposing of the review application, as to whether the purported settlement on the grounds raised by the appellants herein, was a lawful on. Without any application of mind, the High Court proceeded to hold that the agreement was lawful. It did not pose unto itself the right question so as to enable himself to arrive at a finding of fact resulting in correct answer thereto and, thus, the same would amount to a misdirection in law. While doing so, the High Court did not take into consideration the provisions of the Registration Act or the said Act and, in particular, Section 19B, proviso appended to Section 6 and Section 8-B(ii) of the Press & Registration of Books Act, 1867.

32. The High Court also failed and/or neglected to take into consideration the fact that the compromise having been entered into by and between the three out of four partners could not have been termed as settlement of all disputes and in that view of the matter no compromise could have been recorded by it. The effect of the order dated 29.6.1992 recording the settlement was brought to the notice of the High Court, still it failed to rectify the mistake committed by it. The effect of the said order was grave. It was found to be enforceable. It was construed to be an order of the High Court, required to be the implemented by the Courts and the statutory authorities.

33. In Salkia Businessman's Association (supra), this Court observed:

""8. We have carefully considered the submissions of the learned Senior Counsel on either side. The learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench of the High Court have not only oversimplified the matter but seem to have gone on an errand, carried away by some need to balance hypothetical public interest when the real and only question to be considered was as to whether the respondent Authorities are bound by the orders passed by the Court on the basis of the compromise memorandum and whether the proposed move on their part did not constitute flagrant violation of the orders of the Court - very much binding on both the parties. The High Court failed to do justice to its own orders. If courts are not to honour and implement their own orders, and encourage party litigants - be they public authorities, to invent methods of their own to short-circuit and give a go-by to the obligations and liabilities incurred by them under orders of the court - the rule of law will certainly become a casualty in the process - a costly consequence to be zealously averted by all and at any rate by the highest courts in the States in the country. It does not, in our view, require any extraordinary exercise to hold that the memorandum and terms of the compromise in this case became part of the orders of the High Court itself when the earlier writ petition was finally disposed of on 13-2-1991 in the terms noticed supra, notwithstanding that there was no verbatim reproduction of the same in the order. The orders passed in this regard admit of no doubt or give any scope for controversy. While so, it is beyond one's comprehension as to how it could have been viewed as a matter of mere contract between the parties and under that pretext absolve itself of the responsibility to enforce it, except by doing violence to the terms thereof in letter and spirit. As long as the earlier order dated 13-2-1991 stood, it was not permissible to go behind the same to ascertain the substance of it or nature of compliance when the manner, mode and place of compliance had already been stipulated with meticulous care and detail in the order itself. The said decision was also not made to depend upon any contingencies beyond the control of parties in the earlier proceedings.""

34. We may, however, hasten to add that we do not intend to put a seal of our approval to those observations but only wish to point out that as to how courts or the statutory authority may construe a consent order.

35. In terms of Section 141 of the Code of civil Procedure, the provisions thereof are not applicable in a writ proceeding. No provision of the Code of civil Procedure has been made applicable in terms of the rules framed by the High Court of Judicature at Nagpur dated 25.9.1951 framed under Article 225 of the Constitution of India. In any event the applicability of the provisions of the Code of civil Procedure, if any, would be only with regard to the procedural and machinery provisions contained therein but thereby no new right could be created. Even if the provisions of Order 23, Rule 3 of the Code of civil Procedure and/or principles analogous thereto are held to be applicable in a writ proceeding, the Court cannot be permitted to record a purported compromise in a casual manner. It was suo motu required to address itself to the issue as to whether the compromise was a lawful one and, thus, had any jurisdiction to entertain the same. It may be true, as has been contended by Mr. Rao, that the writ petition was maintainable at the threshold. But once it is held that by reason of the purported settlement between the private parties, the High Court was not required to issue any writ, it could only either permit the petitioner to withdraw the writ petition and dismiss the same as having become infructuous. The High Court derives its jurisdictio"

B.N. Kirpal, J.

1. With a view to provide for the constitution of an Electricity Regulatory Commission, restructuring of the electricity industry, rationalisation of the generation, transmission, distribution and supply of electricity avenues for participation of private sector in the electricity industry and generally for taking measures conductive to the development and management of the electricity industry in an efficient, economic and competitive manner and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto, the Andhra Pradesh Electricity Reforms Act, 1998 (hereinafter referred to as ""the Act""), was promulgated by the State. After it received the assent of the President, by Notification dated 27th January, 1999, it came into force with effect from 1st February, 1999.

2. The present dispute arises in connection with fixation of the tariff by the Regulatory Commission which has been constituted under the said Act. The tariff which was impugned by the appellants herein was in respect of the year 1st April, 2000 to 31st March, 2001. This tariff was fixed by a decision of the Regulatory Commission dated 27th May, 2000. In the said order determining the tariff, various contentions which had been raised by the licensees and the other interested parties, including the appellants were considered.

3. The said order dated 27th May, 2000, was challenged by a number of writ petitions filed in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad. By an elaborate judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court dated 16th October, 2000, the writ petition were dismissed and the tariff which was fixed by the order dated 27th May, 2000 followed by a notification under Section 26(6) of the Act was upheld.

4. During the pendency of these appeals, with the passage of time, the tariff for the year which was impugned no longer survives and it has been replaced by tariff for the year 1st April, 2001 to 31st March, 2002. It is a common ground that here has been no challenge to the tariff for the current year. In a sense, therefore, these appeals have become infructuous because no effective relief can be granted as the period for which the tariff was fixed has already expired. Be that as it may, as some issues are likely to arise in the future pertaining to the interpretation of Section 26 of the Act which deals with the fixation of tariffs, we have heard the learned counsel for the parties at great length.

5. It has been contended on behalf of the appellants that on a correct interpretation of Section 26 of the Act, the tariff was required to be fixed by complying with the provisions of Sub-section (9) and further the tariff must necessarily comply with the parameters prescribed in Sub-section (7) of Section 26. It is further the case of the appellants that according to the said Section no undue preference can be shown to any consumer of electricity and there can be no classification of consumers according to the purpose for which the electricity is used. It has also been contended, in this regard, that the tariff which was fixed indicates that the cost of supply of electricity to the industry was much lower than the cost of supply to some of the other consumers like domestic consumers, but by charging more per unit from the industry vis-a-vis the domestic consumers undue preference has been shown and that is not permissible.

6. Section 26 reads as follows:

""26(1). The holder of each licence granted under this Act shall observe the methodologies and procedures specified by the Commission from time to time in calculating the expected revenue from charges which it is permitting to recover pursuant to the terms of its licence and in designing tariffs to collect those revenues.

(2) The Commission shall subject to the provisions of Sub-section (3) be entitled to prescribe the terms and conditions for the determination of the licensee's revenue and tariffs by regulations duly published in the Official Gazette and in such other manner as the Commission considers appropriate.

Provided that in doing so the Commission shall be bound by the following parameters:

(a) the financial principles and their applications provided in the Sixth Schedule to the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 read with Sections 57 and 57A of the said Act;

(b) the factors which would encourage efficiency, economic use of the resources, good performance, optimum investments performance of licence conditions and other matters which the Commission considers appropriate keeping in view the salient objects and purposes of the provisions of this Act; and

(c) the interest of the consumers.

(3) Where the Commission, departs from factors specified in the Sixth Schedule of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 while determining the licensees' revenues and tariffs, it shall record the reasons therefore in writing:

(4) Any methodology or procedure specified by the Commission under Sub-sections (1), (2) and (3) above shall be to ensure that the objectives and purposes of the Act are duly achieved.

(5) Every licensee shall provide to the Commission in a format as specified by the Commission at least 3 months before the ensuing financial year full details of its calculation for that financial year of the expected aggregate revenue from charges which it believes it is permitted to recover pursuant to the terms of its licence and thereafter it shall furnish such further information as the Commission may reasonably require to assess the licensee's calculation. Within 90 days of the date on which the licensee has furnished all the information that the Commission requires, the Commission shall notify the licensee either --

(a) that it accepts the licensee's tariff proposals and revenue calculations, or

(b) that it does not consider the licensee's tariff proposals and revenue calculations to be in accordance with the methodology or procedure in its licence, and such notice to the licensee shall,--

(i) specify fully the reasons why the Commission considers that the licensee's calculation does not comply with the methodology or procedures specified in its licence or is in any way incorrect, and

(ii) propose a modification or an alternative calculation of the expected revenue from charges, which the licensee shall accept.

(6) Each holder of a supply licence shall publish in the daily newspaper having circulation in the area of supply and make available to the public on request the tariff or tariffs for the supply of electricity within its licensed area and such tariff or tariffs shall take effect only after seven days from the date of such publication.

(7) Any tariff implemented under this section, --

(a) shall not show undue preference to any consumer of electricity, but may differentiate according to the consumer's load factor or power factor, the consumer's total consumption of energy during any specified period, or the time at which supply is required; or paying capacity of category of consumer and need for cross-subsidization;

(b) shall be just and reasonable and be such as to promote economic efficiency in the supply and consumption of electricity; and

(c) shall satisfy all other relevant provisions of this Act and the conditions of the relevant licence.

(8) The Commission also shall endeavour to fix tariff in such a manner that, as far as possible, similarly placed consumers in different areas pay similar tariff.

(9) No tariff or part of any tariff required by Sub-section (6) may be amended more frequently than once in any financial year ordinarily except in respect of any changes expressly permitted under the terms of any fuel surcharge formula prescribed by regulations. At least three months before the proposed date for implementation of any tariff or an amendment to a tariff the licensee shall provide details of the proposed tariff or amendment to a tariff to the Commission, together with such further information as the Commission may require to determine whether the tariff or amended tariff would satisfy the provisions of Sub-section (7). If the Commission considers that the proposed tariff or amended tariff of a licensee does not satisfy any of the provisions of Sub-section (7), it shall, within 60 days of receipt of all the information which it required, and after consultation with the Commission Advisory Committee and the licensee, notify the licensee that the proposed tariff or amended tariff is unacceptable to the Commission and it shall provide to the licensee an alternative tariff or amended tariff which shall be implemented by the licensee. The licensee shall not amend any tariff unless the amendment has been approved by the Commission.

(10) Notwithstanding anything contained in Sections 57A and 57B of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 no Rating Committee shall be constituted after the date of this enactment and the Commission shall secure that licensees comply with the provisions of their license regarding their charges for the sale of electricity (both wholesale and retail) and for the connection to and use of their assets or systems in accordance with the provisions of this Act.

Explanation :-

In this section,-

(a) ""the expected revenue from charges"" means the total revenue which a licensee is expected to recover from charges for the level of forecast supply used in the determination under Sub-section (5) above in any financial year in respect of goods or services supplied to customers pursuant to a licensed activity; and

(b) ""tariff"" means a schedule of standard prices or charges for specified services which are applicable to all such specified services provided to the type or types of customers specified in the tariff notification.""

7. A reading of Sub-section (2) indicates that in the determination of the tariff, the financial principles provided in the Sixth Schedule to the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 are applicable unless for reasons recorded in writing, as contemplated by Section 26(3), the Commission departs from the factors specified in the said Sixth Schedule. Sub-section (5) of Section 26 requires every licensee to provide to the Commission at least three months before the ensuing financial year details of its calculation with regard to the expected aggregate revenue from the charges which it believes it is entitled to realise. The Commission is entitled to ask for further particulars and when the data have been supplied the Commission is required within 90 days either to accept the licensee's tariff proposal and revenue calculations or it may proceed under Section 26(5)(b) and, inter alia, propose a modification or an alternative calculation of the expected revenue from the charges which the licensee shall accept.

8. The determination of the Commission either under Section 26(5)(a) or 26(5)(b) is then to be notified under Section 26(6) and seven days after the said publication the tariff so notified is to take effect.

9. There is no doubt that Sub-section (9) of Section 26 is unhappily worded. There does appear, at first blush, some overlapping between Sub-section (5) and Sub-section (9), but on a careful reading of Sub-section (9), we agree with the contention of Shri Shanti Bhusan that Sub-section (9) comes into play only when during the financial year an amendment to the tariff or a new tariff is proposed. Reading Sub-section (5) and Sub-section (9) together, it appears to us that the annual exercise with regard to the fixation of tariff has to be undertaken under Sub-section (5), but if for any reasons there is a new tariff which is to be proposed or an amendment is to take place during the financial year, then the procedures set out in Sub-section (9) of Section 26 has to be followed. It is for this reason that while under Section 26(5) it is stated that the particulars are to be supplied by the licensee at least three months before the ensuing financial year, on the other hand under Section 26(9) the particulars are to be supplied at least three months before the proposed date of implementation. By use of the words 'proposed date of implementation' in contra-distinction to the use of the words 'ensuing financial year' occurring in Sub-section (5), the indication clearly is that Sub-section (9) will apply only in a case of amendment during a financial year. For normal fixation of tariff with or without modification, the exercise which has to be undertaken is under Sub-section (5) of Section 26.

10. We are also unable to agree with the learned counsel for the appellants that the Act does not envisage classification of consumers according to the purpose for which the electricity is used. Sub-section (9) of Section 26 does state that the tariff which is fixed shall not show undue preference to any consumer of electricity but then the said sub-section itself permits differentiation according to the consumer's load factor or power factor, consumer's total consumption of energy during the specified period, time at which the supply is required or paying capacity of category of consumers and the need for cross-subsidization or such tariff as is just and reasonable and be such as to promote economic efficiency in the supply and consumption of electricity and the tariff may also be such as to satisfy all other relevant provisions of the Act and the conditions of the relevant licence. This Section has to be read along with Section 11 which sets out the functions of the Commission and, inter alia, provides that amongst the functions is power to regulate the tariff and charges payable keeping in view both the interest of the consumer as well as the consideration that the supply and distribution cannot be maintained unless the charges for electricity supplied are adequately levied and duly collected. Depending upon the various factors stipulated in Section 26(7), categorisation between industrial and non-industrial, agricultural or domestic consumers can certainly take place. This is precisely what has been done in the present cases. The High Court has to length considered all aspects of the cases and has examined in detail the exercise which was undertaken by the Commission in fixing the tariff and, in our opinion, the view expressed by the High Court calls for no interference.

11. We also agree with the High Court that the judicial review in a matter with regard to fixation of tariff has not to be as that of an appellate authority in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. All that the High Court has to be satisfied is that the Commission has followed the proper procedure and unless it can be demonstrated that its decision is on the face of it arbitrary or illegal or contrary to the Act, the court will not interfere. Fixing a tariff and providing for cross-subsidy is essentially a matter of policy and normally a court would refrain from interfering with a policy decision unless the power exercised is arbitrary or ex facie bad in law.

12. For the aforesaid reasons, we do not find any reason to differ from the view taken by the High Court. We, accordingly, dismiss these appeals with costs.

N.V. Ramana, J.

1. In this appeal by special leave, the Appellant--judgment debtor assails the impugned judgment dated 8th April, 2013 passed by the High Court of Bombay in Civil Revision Application No. 680 of 2011, whereby the High Court has dismissed the application filed by the Appellant seeking declaration that the judgment and Order dated 19th October, 2006 passed by the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division, Patents Court, England (hereinafter referred to as 'the English Court') is not executable before the District Court at Nasik, by confirming the order dated 15th April, 2011 passed by the District Judge-2, Nasik.

2. The facts in nutshell are that the Respondents herein filed a Suit against the Appellant before the English Court for infringement of patent vested in the Respondents besides other reliefs. In the said suit, the Appellant-Defendant filed an application challenging the jurisdiction of the English Court. In that application, the reliefs sought by the Appellant include the relief that the Respondents--original claimants have to pay the costs to the Appellant occasioned by filing the application to be summarily assessed. The English Court by its Order dated 19th October, 2006 dismissed the claim of the Appellant and further directed it to pay the costs of application to the Respondents--original claimants set at  12,229.75. Thereafter it appears that the Appellant agreed to pay the costs and sought for some time. When the Respondents filed a petition for execution in India, the Appellant opposed it in an application on the ground that the order of English Court is not executable. The executing Court dismissed the same which was confirmed by the High Court. Hence the Appellant is before us by way of this appeal.

3. The Appellant made following submissions assailing the judgment of the Courts below-

a. An interlocutory Order of English Court with respect to its own jurisdiction (with or without a direction for payment of costs) does not amount to a judgment 'on merits of the case' and is therefore not conclusive Under Section 13(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code of Civil Procedure for short).

b. In the alternative, the Order of the English Court in the present case does not amount to 'decree' under Explanation 2 to Section 44A of the Code of Civil Procedure.

c. Without prejudice to the aforesaid, the part of the order of the English Court relating to the payment of interest on costs should not be executed in view of the deletion of the erstwhile Section 35(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure.

4. The Respondents have responded in the following manner. The decree passed by the English Court is very much a decree on merits as the English Court has not only given a detailed judgment on merits of the matter but also considered the entire evidence as produced by the parties including oral evidence by way of witness statements, documentary evidence produced by the parties and the application challenging the jurisdiction of the English Court has been decided finally on merits of the case put forth by the Defendants. Nothing further was required to be done insofar as consideration of the application of the Appellant challenging the jurisdiction of the English Court is concerned.

5. It is submitted that Explanation-II to Section 44A is concerned, the same does not refer to costs which are defined Under Section 35 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The costs having been quantified have assumed the character of a money decree for costs which cannot be equated, either with a fines or penalty which is imposed on a party by the Court or taxes payable to a local authority or to a Government or other charges of like nature. It is the submission of the Respondent that the legislative intent was to keep out of the purview of Section 44A the execution of the foreign decree if it related to payment of either taxes or charges of a like nature or a fine or penalty. Even an arbitration award has been excluded. At best it could be argued that compensatory costs in respect of false or vexatious claims which have been defined Under Section 35A could be excluded.

6. It is further submitted that Section 13, Code of Civil Procedure specifically excludes the execution of such decrees which are mentioned under Clauses (a) to (f) thereof and this Section does not mention decrees for the costs.

7. Furthermore they respond that the Judgments Act, 1838 of United Kingdom, as amended in 1993, provides that every judgment debt shall carry interest @ 8%. The Rules framed in U.K. provide for interest to run from the date the judgment is given. The Rules also provide that a judgment or order takes effect from the day when it is given on merits or such dates as Court may specify. The Rules further provide that a party must comply with a judgment or order for the Payment of an amount of money (including costs) within 14 days of the date of judgment or order unless the judgment or order specifies a different date for compliance or any of the Rule specify a different date for compliance or the Court has stayed the proceedings or execution.

8. Moreover, all the Orders of the Court are required to be obeyed and implemented, unless the Court itself sets a date for its non-execution. Otherwise orders will only remain a piece of paper and merely decorate the file of litigant, which would lead to an impression being created in the minds of the litigants that they could with impunity avoid to obey the Court Order. It is neither the legislative intent nor the desire of the Judiciary.

9. Legislative intent of executing Orders relating to payments of costs is clear from amendment carried out to Section 36, Code of Civil Procedure to clarify that the provisions relating to execution of decree or order include payment under a decree or order as well.

10. We have heard the learned Counsel on either side at length and perused the record. The following issues fall for our consideration:

(1) Whether the order passed by the Foreign Court falls within the Exceptions to Section 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure?

(2) Whether the order passed by the Foreign Court amounts to a ""decree"" and the same is executable?

(3) If answer to issue No. 2 is in affirmative, whether the decree for costs would fall within the ambit of Explanation 2 of Section 44A(3) of Code of Civil Procedure and makes it in executable?

(4) Whether interest on costs would fall within the ambit of Explanation 2 of Section 44A of Code of Civil Procedure?

(5) Whether the interest on costs can be executed in India in view of deletion of Section 35(3) of Code of Civil Procedure?

11. In re Issue No. 1 -- Admittedly the English Court passed an order dated 19th October, 2006 dismissing the application passed by the Appellant questioning the jurisdiction of the Court. The Appellant itself at the time of filing the application has prayed the Court to summarily assess the costs to be paid to him in the event of his application being allowed. Both the Appellant--Defendant as well the Respondents--claimants participated in the proceedings by adducing their respective oral as well as documentary evidence. Skelton arguments on behalf of both parties were filed before Court. The Appellant herein has filed Schedule of costs at  25,406.30. Then the English Court has passed a detailed order on 19th October, 2006 on the question of jurisdiction holding that it has jurisdiction to entertain the Suit and also directed the Defendants to pay the costs of the application which was summarily assessed at a sum of  12,429.75.

12. It appears that the Appellant herein has accepted the order and sought for time to pay the costs. Moreover, it did not choose to approach the appellate Court assailing the order and the same has attained finality. In spite of the same, the Appellant filed the application opposing the execution petition filed by the Respondents. The first and foremost ground of attack against the order passed by the English Court is that the order is not conclusive as per Section 13(b), Code of Civil Procedure. Such argument appears to be attractive but we are not able to appreciate the same in the facts and circumstances of the case. Before we proceed further, it is appropriate to have a look at Sections 13 and 14 of Code of Civil Procedure which read as under:

Section 13. When foreign judgment not conclusive: A foreign judgment shall be conclusive as to any matter thereby directly adjudicated upon between the same parties or between parties under whom they or any of them claim litigating under the same title except--

(a) where it has not been pronounced by a Court of competent jurisdiction;

(b) where it has not been given on the merits of the case;

(c) where it appears on the face of the proceedings to be founded on an incorrect view of international law or a refusal to recognise the law of India in cases in which such law is applicable;

(d) where the proceedings in which the judgment was obtained are opposed to natural justice;

(e) where it has been obtained by fraud;

(f) where it sustains a claim founded on a breach of any law in force in India.

Section 14. Presumption as to foreign judgments: The Court shall presume upon the production of any document purporting to be a certified copy of a foreign judgment that such judgment was pronounced by a Court of competent jurisdiction, unless the contrary appears on the record; but such presumption may be displaced by proving want of jurisdiction.

13. A plain reading of Section 13, Code of Civil Procedure would show that to be conclusive an order or decree must have been obtained after following the due judicial process by giving reasonable notice and opportunity to all the proper and necessary parties to put forth their case. When once these requirements are fulfilled, the executing Court cannot enquire into the validity, legality or otherwise of the judgment.

14. A glance on the enforcement of the foreign judgment, the position at common law is very clear that a foreign judgment which has become final and conclusive between the parties is not impeachable either on facts or law except on limited grounds enunciated Under Section 13, Code of Civil Procedure. In construing Section 13, Code of Civil Procedure we have to look at the plain meaning of the words and expressions used therein and need not look at any other factors. Further, Under Section 14, Code of Civil Procedure there is a presumption that the Foreign Court which passed the order is a Court of competent jurisdiction which of course is a rebuttable presumption. In the present case, the Appellant does not dispute the jurisdiction of the English Court but its grievance is, it is not executable on other grounds which are canvassed before us.

15. The Appellant contends that the order of the English Court is not given on merits and that it falls Under Section 13(c) of the Code of Civil Procedure as a result of which it is not conclusive and therefore in executable. We cannot accept such submission. A judgment can be considered as a judgment passed on merits when the Court deciding the case gives opportunity to the parties to the case to put forth their case and after considering the rival submissions, gives its decision in the form of an order or judgment, it is certainly an order on merits of the case in the context of interpretation of Section 13(c) of the Code of Civil Procedure.

16. Applying the same analogy to the facts of the case on hand, we have no hesitation to hold that the order passed by the English Court is an order on merits. The Appellant who has submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the Court and on its own requested the Court to assess the costs summarily. While passing a reasoned order by dismissing the application filed by the Appellant, English Court granted the costs against the Appellant. Had it been the case where Appellant's application was allowed and costs were awarded to it, it would have as well filed a petition for the execution of the order. Be that as it is, the Appellant did not prefer any appeal and indeed sought time to pay the costs. The Appellant, therefore, cannot be permitted to object the execution. It cannot be permitted to blow hot and cold at the same time. In our opinion, it is a pure abuse of process of law and the Courts should be very cautious in entertaining such petitions.

17. In International Woollen Mills v. Standard Wool (UK) Ltd. MANU/SC/0304/2001MANU/SC/0304/2001 : AIR 2001 SC 2134, this Court observed:

...Even where the Defendant chooses to remain ex parte and to keep out, it is possible for the Plaintiff to adduce evidence in support of his claim (and such evidence is generally insisted on by the Courts in India), so that the Court may give a decision on the merits of his case after a due consideration of such evidence instead of dispensing with such consideration and giving a decree merely on account of the default of appearance of the Defendant.

In the former case the judgment will be one on the merits of the case, while in the latter the judgment will be one not on the merits of the case. Thus it is obvious that the non-appearance of the Defendant will not by itself determine the nature of the judgment one way or the other. That appears to be the reason why Section 13 does not refer to ex parte judgments falling under a separate category by themselves...

18. The principles of comity of nation demand us to respect the order of English Court. Even in regard to an interlocutory order, Indian Courts have to give due weight to such order unless it falls under any of the exceptions Under Section 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Hence we feel that the order in the present case passed by the English Court does not fall under any of the exceptions to Section 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure and it is a conclusive one. The contention of the Appellant that the order is the one not on merits deserves no consideration and therefore liable to be rejected. Accordingly, Issue No. 1 is answered.

19. In re Issue No. 2 -- The next ground put forth by the Appellant is that the order being an interlocutory order does not have the shades of a 'judgment' to be executed before the Indian Court and hence the order not being a 'decree' is in executable. To appreciate this, it is appropriate to have a look at Section 44A of Code of Civil Procedure

44A. Execution of decrees passed by Courts in reciprocating territory--

(1) Where a certified copy of decree of any of the superior Courts of any reciprocating territory has been filed in a District Court, the decree may be executed in India as if it had been passed by the District Court.

(2) Together with the certified copy of the decree shall be filed a certificate from such superior Court stating the extent, if any, to which the decree has been satisfied or adjusted and such certificate shall, for the purposes of proceedings under this section, be conclusive proof of the extent of such satisfaction or adjustment.

(3) The provisions of Section 47 shall as from the filing of the certified copy of the decree apply to the proceedings of a District Court executing a decree under this section, and the District Court shall refuse execution of any such decree, if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Court that the decree falls within any of the exceptions specified in Clauses (a) to (f) of Section 13.

Explanation 1-- ""Reciprocating territory"" means any country or territory outside India which the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, declare to be a reciprocating territory for the purposes of this section; and ""superior Courts"", with reference to any such territory, means such Courts as may be specified in the said notification.

Explanation 2.-- ""Decree"" with reference to a superior Court means any decree or judgment of such Court under which a sum of money is payable, not being a sum payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect to a fine or other penalty, but shall in no case include an arbitration award, even if such an award is enforceable as a decree or judgment.

20. As far as the explanation with regard to reciprocal territory is concerned, there is no dispute that England is a reciprocating territory for the purpose of above Section. Section 44A of Code of Civil Procedure indicates an independent right conferred on a foreign decree holder for enforcement of a Decree/Order in India. Section 44A was inserted by Section 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1937 (Act No. 8 of 1937). This Section is meant to give effect to the policy contained in the Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act, 1933. It is a part of the arrangement under which on one part decrees of Indian Courts are made executable in United Kingdom and on the other part, decrees of Courts in the United Kingdom and other notified parts of Her Majesty's dominions are made executable in India. It is to be seen that as United Kingdom is a reciprocating territory and the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division, England being a recognized superior Court in England. Therefore, the order passed by that Court is executable in India Under Section 44A of the Code of Civil Procedure. Now we come to the next limb of the argument put forth by the Appellant that the order passed by the English Court does not amount to a decree and hence it is not executable. It is no doubt correct, Section 44A of Code of Civil Procedure deals with ""execution of decrees passed by Courts in reciprocating territory"". Before we further decide this issue it is appropriate to have a look at how decree, order and foreign judgment are defined under the Code of Civil Procedure.

21. As per Section 2(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, ""decree"" means the formal expression of an adjudication which, so far as regards the Court expressing it, conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit and may be either preliminary or final. It shall be deemed to include the rejection of a plaint and the determination of any question within Section 144 of Code of Civil Procedure but shall not include (a) any adjudication from which an appeal lies as an appeal from an order, or (b) any order of dismissal for default.

Then a ""foreign judgment"" is defined Under Section 2(6) as judgment of a foreign Court. ""Judgment"" as per Section 2(9) of Code of Civil Procedure means the statement given by the Judge on the grounds of a decree or order. Order is defined Under Section 2(14) of Code of Civil Procedure as a formal expression of any decision of the Civil Court which is not a 'decree'. Then Explanation 2 to Section 44A(3) says ""decree"" with reference to a superior Court means any 'decree' or 'judgment'. As per the plain reading of the definition 'Judgment' means the statement given by the Judge on the grounds of decree or order and order is a formal expression of a Court. Thus ""decree"" includes judgment and ""judgment"" includes ""order"". On conjoint reading of 'decree', 'judgment' and 'order' from any angle, the order passed by the English Court falls within the definition of 'Order' and therefore, it is a judgment and thus becomes a ""decree"" as per Explanation to Section 44A(3) of Code of Civil Procedure. In this case, the Court at England, after following the principles of natural justice, by recording reasons and very importantly basing on the application of the Appellant itself, has conclusively decided the issue with regard to jurisdiction and passed the order coupled with costs. Hence in our considered opinion, the order passed by the Foreign Court is conclusive in that respect and on merits. Hence executable as a decree and accordingly the issue is answered.

22. In re Issue Nos. 3 & 4 -- The next contention advanced is that the decree for costs does not attract the Explanation II of Section 44A which concerns itself with taxation or other charges of like nature or in respect of fine or other penalty. We have to first see the nature of the costs imposed by the decree for interpreting the relevant explanation. Before referring to the principles/guidelines in the decisions cited, it would be apposite to advert to the concept of 'costs' and the general principles governing the award of costs. Law Commission in its 240th Report on ""Costs on Civil Litigation"" provides valuable resource on nature of costs in India as well as England.

23. The 'costs' signifies the sum of money which the Court orders one party to pay to another party in respect of the expenses of litigation incurred. Except where specifically provided by the statute or by Rules of the Court, the costs of proceedings are in the Court's discretion.

24. In Johnstone v. The Law Society of Prince Edward Island 2 PEIR B-28 (1988), the Canadian Court of Appeal speaking through McQuaid, J described costs in the following words:

... the sum of money which the court orders one party to pay another party in an action as compensation for the expense of litigation incurred. The definition continues to the effect that costs are awarded as compensation (i.e. reimbursement); there is, unlike damages, no restitution in integrum, that is to say, no concept in costs, as there exists in damages, that the injured person should be placed, in so far as money can do so, in the same position as he occupied before the injury was suffered.

25. Under the Federal Rules of Civil Proceeding (USA), ""costs shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs."" In most of the States in US, the attorney's fee is not allowed as litigation cost. Costs can even be on interim Application. A bill of costs is a certified, itemized statement of the amount of the expenses incurred in bringing or defending a law suit/proceeding. The charges/expenses claimed are taxed by the Court or its officer according to the procedural Rules and set of norms.

26. The basis of assessment of costs in UK has been explained thus in Halsbury's Laws of England:

Where the court is to assess the amount of costs (whether by summary or detailed assessment) it will assess those costs on the standard basis or on the indemnity basis, but the court will not in either case allow costs which have been unreasonably incurred or are unreasonable in amount. Where the amount of costs is to be assessed on the standard basis, the court will only allow costs which are proportionate to the matters in issue and will resolve any doubt which it may have as to whether costs were reasonably incurred or reasonable and proportionate in amount in favour of the paying party. Where the amount of costs is to be assessed on the indemnity basis, the court will resolve any doubt which it may have as to whether costs were reasonably incurred or were reasonable in amount in favour of the receiving party. Where the court makes an order about costs without indicating the basis on which the costs are to be assessed, or makes an order for costs to be assessed on a basis other than the standard basis or the indemnity basis, the costs will be assessed on the standard basis.

27. The Part 44 of the Code of Civil Procedure Rules (CPR) in the USA contains general Rules about costs and entitlement to costs. The Rules are supplemented by practice direction. However, part 44 does not apply to the assessment of costs to the extent different provisions exist, for e.g., Access to Justice Act, 1999 and the Legal Aid Act, 1988. Further, the general Rule that the unsuccessful party will be ordered to pay the costs of the successful party unless the court makes a different order does not apply to family proceedings.

28. It is important to note that a penalty in this sense normally means a sum payable to the State, not to a private claimant, so the costs imposed on the basis of the indemnity is not a penalty or tax. Therefore, the Explanation II to Section 44A does not refer to the costs as contemplated Under Section 35 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The costs having been quantified have assumed the character of a money decree for costs and cannot be equated, either with a fine or penalty which is imposed on a party by the Court or taxes claimed and are taxes payable to a local authority, Government, or other charges of a like nature.

29. The Appellant has advanced an argument that as per Section 35A of the Code of Civil Procedure, no Court should pass any order for the payment of compensatory costs exceeding Rs. 3,000/- or exceeding the limits of its pecuniary jurisdiction of the said Court whichever amount is less. It is thus argued by the Appellant that in the present case, since the costs imposed exceed the bar imposed by Section 35A, therefore, the order of the English Court is not executable in the present case.

30. This argument lacks merit and deserves to be rejected. A bare perusal of Section 35A shows that bar operates on the Indian Courts with regard to imposition of costs in respect of false or vexatious claims or defences. The bar is not attracted in the present case as the Court that has ordered the costs is the High Court of Justice in England which is not governed by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and that the Respondent merely approached the Indian Courts for the satisfaction of a foreign decree. Moreover, the nature of compensatory costs prescribed in Section 35A of the Code of Civil Procedure are different from 'costs' dealt with in Section 35 of the Code of Civil Procedure as the former are limited to the claims of defences of a party which are frivolous or vexatious. It is settled that before awarding costs Under Section 35A of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Court should satisfy itself that the claim was false or vexatious to the knowledge of the party who put it forward and that the interests of justice require the award of such compensatory costs. In the present case, no claim has been advanced by the Appellant that the claim filed by the Respondents is false or vexatious, therefore, the bar in Section 35A is not applicable. Accordingly the issue is answered.

31. In re Issue No. 5 -- It is the case of the Appellant that the claim for interest on costs is not recognized in the Indian law. It is to be noted that matters of procedure are to be governed by the lex fori, whereas the matters of the substance are governed by lex causae. In this case, the question whether the interest on sum of decree of costs to be executed in India is a matter of substance as the interest on decree is a substantive right of the decree holder and does not concern itself with the procedural law of the forum.

32. The Appellant relied upon Section 35 of the Code of Civil Procedure which enables Courts in India to impose litigation costs at the discretion of the Court. However, there is no provision under the Code of Civil Procedure or the Interest Act, 1978 which permits imposition of interest on litigation costs. Further tried to impress upon that the amended Section 35(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure permitted a Civil Court to grant interest on costs. The unamended Section 35(3) stated as follows:

The Court may give interest on costs at any rate not exceeding six per cent per annum, and such interest shall be added to the costs and shall be recoverable as such.

This Provision was consciously omitted in 1956 (pursuant to Act 66 of 1956). In view of the deletion of Section 35(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure, it is argued that grant of interest on costs is no longer recognized under India law.

33. In this context, it is educative to read the following comments made in the Debate on the Bill against the deletion of Section 35(3), by Hon'ble Member of Lok Sabha Shri Tek Chand;

..In this connection, a reference has been made to Section 35, Sub-section (3), which according to Clause 3 of the Bill, is to be omitted. Not that I have usurious propensities, but I do not like this provision. It is true that there should not be any profiteering by the people; I concede that, but there are instances when the costs amount to five figures or more, and there is no reason why, when an unsuccessful party is subjecting the successful party not only to a long dilatory and unending dispute, but also to frivolous and vexatious litigation whereby he is out of pocket to the tune of several thousands, the law or the legislature should be so solicitous that such person should not pay interest, if he does not propose to pay or if he intends to delay the payment of the costs. One unfortunate and unhappy feature of administration of civil law in our land, is apart from delays and objections of frivolous and vexatious nature, justice is made available, if at all, at a very high and exorbitant price.

34. The Hon'ble Member of Lok Sabha thus articulated that omitting Sub-section (3) would encourage delay in realization of decree costs. A reference to the Report of Law Commission and the views expressed in Debate on the Bill, as extracted in the Law Commission Report (supra), would indicate that the consequences of deletion of Sub-section (3) of Section 35 were very much considered by the Parliament. When the idea of deletion is not to encourage interest on costs as a source of income to the litigants, the Parliament did not choose positively to prohibit interest on costs by inserting suitable Clause in Section 35.

35. It is to the reciprocal advantage of the Courts of all nations to enforce foreign rights as far as practicable. To this end, broad recognition of substantive rights should not be defeated by some vague assumed limitations of the Court. When substantive rights are so bound up in a foreign remedy, the refusal to adopt the remedy would substantially deprive parties of their rights. The necessity of maintaining the foreign rights outweighs the practical difficulties involved in applying the foreign remedy. In India, although the interest on costs are not available due to exclusion of Section 35(3), the same does not mean that Indian Courts are powerless to execute the decree for interest on costs. Indian Courts are very much entitled to address the issue for execution of the interest amount. The right to 8% interest as per the Judgments Act, 1838 of UK can be recognized and as well as implemented in India.

36. Therefore, we are of the considered opinion that the Execution Petition filed by the Respondents for execution of the order dated 19th October, 2006 passed by the English Court is maintainable under the relevant provisions. Therefore, we do not find any reason to interfere with the impugned order. Resultantly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.

1. We have heard learned Counsel for the respective parties. Although basic question of law is common in both the appeals, there are some variations in the facts and wherever relevant the said differences will be pointed out. For the sake of convenience, we are taking the facts from C.A. No. 9891 of 2010. The Appellant - Arbind Kumar was appointed as a Constable in Dhanbad District on 31st March, 1998. There is no dispute that the provisions in the Police Manual for such appointment were not followed and without inviting applications from the eligible persons, Appellant's case for appointment was allegedly recommended by the Superintendent of Police, Dhanbad to the Director General cum Inspector General of Police (Welfare) Bihar Patna (DG cum IG), on the ground that father of the Appellant was an Assistant Sub Inspector of police and had met with an accident on 2nd August, 1997 and sustained injuries leading to amputation of right leg. It is not in dispute that father of the Appellant continued to serve the police force till he superannuated sometime in 2005.

2. So far as the two Appellants in the other appeal i.e. C.A. No. 9892 of 2010, are concerned, they claim to be brave persons who helped the police against the naxalites and as a result, both of them were recommended for appointment by the then Superintendent of Police, Dhanbad to the DG cum IG, Bihar, Patna and after their cases were cleared by the DG cum IG, they were appointed as constables on 16th October, 1996.

3. The Appellants underwent training and began working as constables. When the fact of such appointments made without adhering to the provisions in the Police Manual came to light, the Home Secretary, Government of Bihar issued a Communication in September, 2000 to issue notice to persons appointed in such manner against law and to cancel such appointments if they were so found. As a result of such exercise, the service of the Appellants came to be terminated in 2002 and 2003. The termination was after serving show cause notice on the simple ground that the appointments were made through a process unknown to law and in total disregard of the relevant provisions in the Police Manual. Some controversy was raised as to whether show cause notice was served on the Appellant-Arbind Kumar but it has been pointed out that his show cause as well as the notice is annexed as Annexure P-6.

4. On behalf of the Arbind Kumar, reliance has been placed on a judgment of this Court in the case of Arun Kumar Rout and Ors. v. State of Bihar and Ors. MANU/SC/1641/1998MANU/SC/1641/1998 : 1998 (9) SCC 71, whereby this Court in the peculiar facts of that case directed for framing a scheme for absorption/regularisation of the appointees who were working as temporary or ad-hoc for a long number of years. The judgment itself makes it clear that the order was passed Under Article 142 of the Constitution of India with a specific observation that it shall not be treated as a precedent. Hence, we are not persuaded to follow that course of action in the present case. Although the Appellants have pleaded that they are mere victims of irregular or illegal action by the concerned police officials who appointed them to the post of Constable without following the procedure prescribed under the Police Manual and hence deserve sympathy, but we are not persuaded to accept such submission. In our considered view, the beneficiaries cannot blame the appointing authority alone and claim that the illegal appointment should be continued in perpetuity. To accept such plea would amount to giving premium to dishonest and illegal acts in matters of public appointments. The Appellants were terminated as soon as Authorities came to know of such illegal appointments. They had not completed even ten years so as to perhaps raise a claim for one time consideration for regularisation in terms of judgment of the Constitution Bench in Secretary, State of Karnataka and Ors. v. Uma Devi (3) and Ors. MANU/SC/1918/2006MANU/SC/1918/2006 : (2006) 4 SCC 1. In the facts of the case, we find no merit in these appeals, they are accordingly dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.

G.B. Pattanaik, J.

1. These appeals are directed against the judgment of Andhra Pradesh High Court in Letters Patent Appeals Nos. 351 and 352 of 1989. The land in question measuring 3.42 acres was acquired for construction of houses for Tribals and Harijans by issuance of notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, published on 9.6.1976. A second Notification was issued under said Section 4 to acquire an extent of 1.06 acres by publication of Notification dated 27.12.1976. The Land Acquisition Officer determined the market value of the acquired land @ Rs. 11,000/- per acre by his award dated 31.2.1977. Before the Land Acquisition Officer, the land owners had claimed compensation @ Rs. 25,000/- Rs. 30,000/- per acre. On a reference being made under Section 18 of the Act, the Civil Court determined the market value of the acquired land at Rs. 75,000/- per acre, but granted compensation @ Rs. 30,000/- per acre in view of Section 25 of the Act, as it stood prior to its amendment in the year 1984 and as the owners had claimed @ Rs. 30,000/- per acre. On appeal being carried, the learned Single Judge also came to the conclusion that the market value of the land would be Rs. 75,000/- per acre, but did not enhance the compensation in view of the un-amended provisions of Section 25 of the Act and in view of the fact that the owners had claimed only Rs. 30,000/- per acre before the Land Acquisition Officer. The matter being carried to the Division Bench in Letters Patent Appeal, the Division Bench came to the conclusion that Section 25 being procedural in nature and the amendment having been made while the appeal was pending, the amended provisions of Section 25 of the Land Acquisition Act would apply and since under the amended provisions, there is no bar for awarding compensation more than the amount claimed by the claimants and the only embargo being that the amount shall not be awarded less than the amount awarded by the Collector under Section 11, the Court would be justified in enhancing the compensation if the market value is determined at a higher rate. On the question of determination of market value, the Division Bench, taking into consideration Exhibits B-3, B-4, and B-7, came to held that the market value of the acquired land would be Rs. one lakh per acre. The appeals having been allowed with the aforesaid conclusions, the State is in appeal before this Court.

2. Mr. Guntur Prabhakar, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant contended that the Division Bench of the High Court committed serious error in holding that Section 25 is procedural in nature and thereby applying the amended provisions of Section 25 of the Act. According to him, the provisions of Section 25 mandates the parameters within which the Court is required to determine the amount of compensation and the act of awarding of compensation or curtailing, restricting or adding to such right can never be held to be procedural in nature. According to the learned counsel the language itself reveals that it is substantive in nature and it has been so held by this Court in the case of Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti v. Kanhaiya Lal and Ors. MANU/SC/0625/2000MANU/SC/0625/2000 : AIR2000SC3282 . That being the position, the substantive right of the party would be governed by the un-amended provisions of Section 25 of the Act. Consequently, it is urged that the claimants having claimed only Rs. 30,000/- per acre, the Court will not be entitled to grant compensation beyond the amount claimed. According to Mr. Prabhakar, the Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court committed serious error of law, which was vitiated the ultimate conclusion.

3. Mr. P.P. Rao, the learned senior counsel appearing for the claimants-respondents on the other hand contended that the lawyer for the claimants without any authority from the claimants, made the application, even before the notice had been served on the claimants and in such an application, mentioned the claim at the rate of Rs. 30,000/- per acre and such a claim cannot be held to be a claim made by the claimants, within the ambit of the un-amended provisions of Section 25(1) of the Act. Mr. Rao further contended that the very fact, the Parliament amended Section 25 of the Act and took away the earlier embargo with regard to the quantum of compensation, limiting the same to the amount claimed by the claimants is indicative of the legislative intent. That being the position and the Court having determined the market value of the acquired land at Rs. one lakh per acre, there is no justification to deny that amount to the claimants, since under Article 31 of the Constitution, no person can be deprived of his property, save by the authority of law. Mr. Rao further submitted that the unamended provisions of Section 25 is ultra vires and such a prayer has been made in the writ petition filed by the claimants under Article 32 of the Constitution. Mr. Rao lastly submitted that in the peculiar, facts of this case, even if this Court may declare the law and point out the error in the Division Bench Judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, yet ends of justice would not require interference with the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court in exercise of power under Article 136 of the Constitution. In support of this contention, reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in Taherakhatoon v. Salambin Mohammad MANU/SC/0139/1999MANU/SC/0139/1999 : [1999]1SCR901 .

4. Before embarking upon an inquiry as to the correctness of the contentions raised, it would be appropriate to notice the provisions of Section 25 of the Land Acquisition Act, as it stood prior to its amendment and the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, as it stand subsequent to the amendment.

""Section 25, prior to its amendment by Act 68 of 1984:

'25. Rules as to amount of Compensation- (1) When the applicant has made a claim to compensation, pursuant to any notice given under Section 9, the amount awarded to him by the Court shall not exceed the amount so claimed or be less than the amount awarded by the Collector under Section 11.

(4) When the applicant has refused to make such claim or has omitted without sufficient reason (to be allowed by the Judge) to make such claim, the amount awarded by the Court shall is no case exceed the amount awarded by the Collector.

(5) When the applicant has omitted for a sufficient reason (to be allowed by the Judge) to make such claim, the amount awarded to him by the Court shall not be less than and may exceed the amount awarded by the Collector.""

Section 25 after the amendment:-

""Section 25. Amount of compensation by Court not be lower than the amount awarded by the Collector:- The amount of compensation awarded by the Court shall not be less than the amount awarded by the Collector under Section 11.""

5. At this stage it would be proper to notice the scheme of the Act itself. After publication of preliminary notification under Section 4 of the Act and causing public notice of the substance of such notification by the Collector, objections are entertained and heard, as provided under Section 5A of the Act. The Appropriate Government then becomes satisfied that the land is needed for public purpose and a declaration to that effect is made under Section 6 of the Act. Such declaration is the conclusive evidence that the land is needed for a public purpose. The Appropriate Government or the officer authorised by the Appropriate Government directs the Collector to take order for the acquisition of the land, as provided under Section 7 and the Collector then cause the land to be marked and measured and also he is supposed to make a plan of the same. The Collector thereafter cause public notice to be given at convenient places on or near the land, stating that the Government intends to take possession of the land and that claims to compensation for all interests in such land may be made to him, as provided under Section 9. The notice under Section 9(1) must state the necessary particulars, as provided under Sub-section (2) of said Section and the Collector then serves notice on the occupier of the land as well as on all such persons known or believed to be interested therein or would be entitled to act for persons so interested, or agents authorised to receive service on their behalf within the revenue district in which the land is situate. In case the person interested resides elsewhere as has no such agent, the notice is required to be sent to him by post in a letter addressed to him at his last known address, under Sub- section (4) of Section 9. Section 11 confers power on the Collector to hold an inquiry with regard to the measurements made as well as inquiry to the valuation of the land on the date of Notification under Section 4(1) and thereafter it shall make an Award under his hand. Such Award of the Collector is required to be filed in the Collector's Office and under law is held to be final and conclusive evidence, as between the Collector and the persons interested on the question of true area and value of the land and apportionment of the compensation among the persons interested. We are not concerned with other provisions except Section 18 and Section 25. Section 18 entitles the person interested who has not accepted the award to make a written application to the Collector, requiring that the matter of determination of compensation be referred to a competent Court. Section 25 however, as it stood prior to its amendment by Act 68 of 1984, puts an embargo to the effect that if an applicant has made a claim to compensation pursuant to any notice given under Section 9, then the amount awarded to him by the Court shall not exceed the amount so claimed and shall not be less than the amount awarded by the Collector under Section 11. The aforesaid provision contained in Sub-section (1) of Section 25, thus limits the power of the reference Court on a reference being made under Section 18 to the quantum of compensation which could be awarded.

6. When these appeals had been listed before a Bench of two learned Judges of this Court, the decision of this Court in Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti MANU/SC/0625/2000MANU/SC/0625/2000 : AIR2000SC3282 : AIR2000SC3282 , had been placed before the Bench and it was contended that since the award in the case in hand is between 30th of September, 1982 and 24th of September, 1984, the compensation could be awarded under the amended provisions of Section 25. Since that decision prima facie supported the contention of the claimants-respondents and the Bench was of the view that the said decision requires re-consideration, the matter had been referred to a Bench of three learned Judges and that is how the matter has been placed before us. On the rival submissions made by the counsel for the parties, the following questions arise for our consideration:

(1) Can the provision of Section 25 of the Land Acquisition Act be construed to be procedural in nature or is substantive?

(2) If it is held to be substantive in nature, then can the amended provisions of Section 25 of the Act would apply to a case where the award of the Land Acquisition Collector had been made much prior to the amendment in question?

(3) Whether the Judgment of this Court in Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti's case can be held to be correctly decided?

(4) Whether at all it would be appropriate for this Court to lay down the law and yet not to interfere with the judgment of the Division Bench of Andhra Pradesh High Court with regard to the quantum of compensation awarded?

(5) Whether the petition under Article 32 can be entertained for deciding the validity of un-amended provisions of Section 25?

7. So far as the first question is concerned, on a plain reading of the same, it is difficult for us to hold that it is procedural in nature. On the other hand, it unequivocally limits the power of the Court on a reference being made to award compensation, more than the amount claimed by the claimants and less than the amount awarded by the Collector. In other words, the substantive right of a claimant who has made a claim to the compensation, pursuant to a notice under Section 9, cannot be more than the amount claimed and under any circumstances, would not be less than the amount which the Land Acquisition Collector has awarded under Section 11, since the award of the Collector is the offer that is made to the claimant. In course of the arguments, Mr. Rao, the learned counsel for the claimants submitted before us that Sub-section (5) of Section 25, as it stood prior to its amendment gives sufficient power to the reference Court to entertain a claim if the claimant had omitted to make such claim pursuant to notice issued under Section 9 and determine the compensation on that. Consequently, Mr. Rao contends that there should not be any embargo on the power of the Court even if the claimant makes a claim pursuant to the notice issued under Section 9. We are unable to accept this submission inasmuch as Sub-section (5) of Section 25 contemplates a situation where the claimant for sufficient reason had omitted to make a claim and the reference Court on being satisfied about the same may permit the claimant to make a claim. But the unambiguous and clear language of Sub-section (1) of Section 25, as it stood prior to the amendment, makes it explicitly clear that if the claimant has made a claim pursuant to a notice under Section 9, then the Court would be incompetent to award any amount exceeding the said claim. In our considered opinion, Sub-section (5) of Section 25 will be of no assistance to the claimants- respondents in the present case. Incidentally, we may deal with the submission of Mr. Rao that the amount claimed was by the lawyer and not by the claimant himself and therefore, cannot be held to be claim by the claimants, pursuant to notice under Section 9 of the Act. On examining the records of the case, we do not find any justification to entertain this submission, inasmuch even in the application made for reference under Section 18, the claimant had not taken such a stand. It would, therefore, be futile for us to entertain this contention and hold that the claim made by the claimants through his lawyer cannot be held to be a claim by the claimants. This Court in the very case of Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti MANU/SC/0625/2000MANU/SC/0625/2000 : AIR2000SC3282 : AIR2000SC3282 , on which the learned counsel for the respondents had placed reliance, considered the provisions of Section 25 and held that the said provision can never be held to be procedural and it is substantive in nature. We approve to the said conclusion and held that the provision of Section 25 of the Land Acquisition Act is substantive in nature.

8. Coming to the second question, it is a well settled principle of construction that a substantive provision cannot be retrospective in nature unless the provision itself indicates the same. The amended provision of Section 25 nowhere indicates that the same would have any retrospective effect. Consequently, therefore, it would apply to all acquisitions made subsequent to 24.9.84, the date on which Act 68/1984 came into force. The Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill of 1982 was introduced in Parliament on 30th of April, 1982 and came into operation with effect from 24th of September, 1984. Under the amendment in question, the provisions of Section 23(2) dealing with solatium was amended and Section 30(2) of the amended Act provided that the provisions of Sub-section (2) of Section 23 of the Principal Act as amended by Clause (b) of Section 15 shall apply and shall be deemed to have applied, also to and in relation to any award made by the Collector or Court or to any order passed by the High Court or Supreme Court in appeal against any such award under the provisions of the principal Act, after the 30th April, 1982 and before the commencement of the Act. It is because of the aforesaid provision, the question cropped up as to whether in respect of an award passed by the Collector between the two dates, the amended provision will have an application or not and that question has been answered by this Court in the Constitution Bench decision in Union of India and Anr. v. Raghubir Singh MANU/SC/0619/1989MANU/SC/0619/1989 : [1989]178ITR548(SC) . Sub-section (2) of Section 30 has at all no reference to the provisions of Section 25 of the Act. In that view of the matter, question of applicability of the amended provisions of Section 25 of the Act to an award of the Collector made earlier to the amendment and the matter was pending in appeal, does not arise. In our considered opinion, the amended provisions of Section 25 of the Act, not being retrospective in nature, the case in hand would be governed by the unamended provisions of Section 25 of the Act.

9. Coming to the third question, we find that on a review application being filed, this court relying upon the case of Union of India v. Raghubir Singh MANU/SC/0619/1989MANU/SC/0619/1989 : [1989]178ITR548(SC) , held that the amended provisions would be applicable under which there is no restriction that the award would only be upto the amount claimed by the claimant. In Raghubir Singh's case, the Constitution Bench was dealing with Sub- section (2) of Section 30 which had got absolutely no relevance or connection with the provisions of Section 25 of the Land Acquisition Act. For the reasons already indicated, we have no hesitation to come to the conclusion that the enunciation of law made by this Court in Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti's case, in para (17) of the Judgment relying upon the case of Union of India v. Raghubir Singh, is not correct and to that extent the aforesaid case must be held not to have been correctly decided.

10. Coming to the next question as to whether this Court would interfere with the impugned judgment of the Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court or not, the answer would depend on the provision of law which was under consideration and whether there was any ambiguity in the law which is being decided for the first time. It is no doubt true that in Teherkhatoon v. Salambin Mohammad, MANU/SC/0139/1999MANU/SC/0139/1999 : [1999]1SCR901 , this Court has held that even if the special leave has been granted under Article 136, unless and until, it is shown that a substantial and grave injustice will be caused if no interference is made out, the Court may refuse to interfere with the judgment under challenge. This principle would mainly depend upon the facts of each case which comes up for decision before the Court. To the case in hand, it is difficult for us to apply the aforesaid principle. On the date the land was notified for acquisition under Section 4(1) of the Act, the un-amended provision of Section 25 was in force and it was made known to all concerned that the reference Court will have no power to award the amount in excess of the amount claimed by the claimants. Not only the language of the Statute was clear and unambiguous, but also the question was not res- integra, in view of the decision of this Court in Dadoo Yogendrenath Singh v. The Collector MANU/SC/0270/1977MANU/SC/0270/1977 : [1977]2SCR757 . Until the statutory rigour contained in Sub-section (1) of Section 25 stood obliterated by the amended provisions of Section 25 and until all restraints and embargoes placed for the Court stood totally liberated, the reference Court had no jurisdiction to award the amount in excess of the amount claimed by the Claimant. Such being the position of law, we are unable to persuade ourselves to agree with the submission of Mr. Rao to hold that it would not be in the interest of justice to interfere with the judgment of the Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court. In our considered opinion, the High Court had no jurisdiction on the law as it stood, to award any amount in excess of the amount claimed and in the case in hand in excess of Rs. 30,000/- per acre and, therefore, the principles enunciated in the decision of this Court in Teherakhatoon v. Salambin Mohammad MANU/SC/0139/1999MANU/SC/0139/1999 : [1999]1SCR901 : [1999]1SCR901 , cannot be applied to the case in hand.

11. So far as the last submission is concerned, we are afraid that the validity of unamended provision of Section 25 of the Land Acquisition Act which was there on the statue book since inception can at all be examined at a point of time when that provision no longer subsists since 24.9.84, the date on which Act 68/1984 came into force. We, therefore, decline to entertain the petition under Article 32 at the behest of the claimants. In the net result, therefore, these civil appeals are allowed. The Judgment of the Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court is set aside and it is held that the claimants-respondents would be entitled to compensation for the acquired land @ Rs. 30,000/- per acre, which they claimed pursuant to service of notice under Section 9. The writ petition filed by the claimants stands dismissed.

1. A show cause notice dated 28-5-2001 was issued by the Appellant i.e. The Additional Director General, Directorate General of Central Excise to Respondent No. 1 proposing to recover a sum of Rs. 27.32 lacs. This notice was issued under the provisions of the Central Excise Act. Instead of replying to the said notice, Respondent No. 1 filed suit before the City Civil Court, Chennai challenging the validity of the said show cause notice on various grounds. Along with the suit, application under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 was also filed seeking interim injunction to restrain the Central Excise officials to adjudicate on the aforesaid show cause notice. The said suit was decreed ex parte vide order dated 9-8-2001 by the Trial Court. Against the said ex parte decree, the Appellant filed revision petition invoking the provisions of Article 227 of the Constitution. The plea of the Appellant was that the Civil Court did not have the jurisdiction to entertain such a suit which was predicated on two grounds viz. (1) the jurisdiction of Civil Court was impliedly barred under Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure inasmuch as the Central Excise Act provides for complete machinery for adjudication of such disputes. (2) The suit filed against the show cause notice was premature and there was no cause of action to file such a suit when the said show cause notice was yet to be adjudicated upon. The High Court vide the impugned order dated 23-12-2005 [MANU/TN/2446/2005MANU/TN/2446/2005 : 2006 (203) E.L.T. 193 (Mad.)] has not decided the aforesaid contentions of the Appellant on merits. Instead, it has remanded the case back to the Trial Court with a direction to frame a specific issue on jurisdiction and decide the same after affording reasonable opportunity to both the parties. This order of the High Court is the subject matter of the present appeal. Though the Respondents were served, no one has put any appearance. In these circumstances, we have no option but to hear Mr. Radhakrishnan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Appellant alone.

2. We have gone through the subject matter of the dispute which was raised in the Civil Suit filed by Respondent No. 1. After going through the same, we are in agreement with the submissions of Mr. Radhakrishnan on both the counts as mentioned above. The Appellant had simply issued the show cause notice to Respondent No. 1. This notice has been issued under the provisions of Central Excise Act. The validity of such a show cause notice could not be gone into in a suit filed by the notice. As rightly pointed out by Mr. Radhakrishnan, various provisions of the Central Excise Act provide for complete machinery for adjudication of such show cause notice. Opportunity was given to Respondent No. 1 to reply to the said show cause notice. After grant of hearing, the adjudicating authority was supposed to pass the order on the show cause notice. There is a provision in challenging such an order by filing appeal. In this scenario, we are of the opinion that the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is clearly barred Under Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure on the principles laid down by this Court in Dhulabhai v. State of M.P. MANU/SC/0157/1968MANU/SC/0157/1968 : AIR 1969 SC 78, wherein this Court inter alia held as under:

""32. Neither of the two cases of Firm of Illuri Subayya (1) or Kamla Mills (2) can be said to run counter to the series of cases earlier noticed. The result of this inquiry into the diverse views expressed in this Court may be stated as follows:

(1) Where the statute gives a finality to the orders of the special tribunals the Civil Courts' jurisdiction must be held to be excluded if there is adequate remedy to do what the Civil Courts would normally do in a suit. Such provision, however, does not exclude those cases where the provisions of the particular Act have not been complied with or the statutory tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure.

(2) Where there is an express bar of the jurisdiction of the Court, an examination of the scheme of the particular Act to find the adequacy or the sufficiency of the remedies provided may be relevant but is not decisive to sustain the jurisdiction of the Civil Court.

Where there is no express exclusion the examination of the remedies and the scheme of the particular Act to find out the intendment becomes necessary and the result of the inquiry may be decisive. In the latter case it is necessary to see if the statute creates a special right or a liability and provides for the determination of the right or liability and further lays down that all questions about the said right and liability shall be determined by the tribunals so constituted, and whether remedies normally associated with actions in Civil Courts are prescribed by the said statute or not.

(3) Challenge to the provisions of the particular Act as ultra vires cannot be brought before Tribunals constituted under that Act. Even the High Court cannot go into that question on a revision or reference from the decision of the Tribunals.

(4) When a provision is already declared unconstitutional or the constitutionality of any provision is to be challenged, a suit is open. A writ of certiorari may include a direction for refund if the claim is clearly within the time prescribed by the Limitation Act but it is not a compulsory remedy to replace a suit.

(5) Where the particular Act contains no machinery for refund' of tax collected in excess of constitutional limits or illegally collected a suit lies.

(6) Questions of the correctness of the assessment apart from its constitutionality are for the decision of the authorities and a civil suit does not lie if the orders of the authorities are declared to be final or there is an express prohibition in the particular Act. In either case the scheme of the particular Act must be examined because it is a relevant enquiry.

(7) An exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is not readily to be inferred unless the conditions above set down apply.""

3. Section 35(c)(iv) of the Central Excise Act specifically provides that orders passed by the Appellate Tribunal on appeal shall be final. Even otherwise, when the matter was still at the show cause notice stage and no adverse order has been passed against Respondent No. 1, there was no cause of action to file such a suit. We, thus, set aside the impugned order of the High Court. As a consequence two suits filed by Respondent No. 1 are also dismissed. The appeal is, accordingly, allowed.

Madan B. Lokur, J.

1. In Civil Appeal No. 9078 of 2016 and Civil Appeal No. 9079 of 2016 filed by Afcons Infrastructure Ltd., the challenge is to the judgment and orders dated 28th July, 2016 and 11th August, 2016 passed by the Bombay High Court. In Civil Appeal Nos. 9080-9081 of 2016 filed by the Nagpur Metro Rail Corporation Ltd., the challenge is to the judgment and orders dated 28th July, 2016 and 12th August, 2016 passed by the Bombay High Court. The combined effect of all the impugned orders is that the High Court held that M/s. Guangdong Yuantian Engineering Company (GYT) of China and M/s. TATA Projects Limited (TPL) as a Joint Venture (hereinafter referred to as the 'GYT-TPL JV') are eligible to bid for a tender invited by the Nagpur Metro Rail Corporation Limited (for short 'NMRCL') on 12th May, 2016.

2. Bids were invited by NMRCL for the design and construction of a viaduct in Reach-3 between Jhansi Rani Square and Lokmanya Nagar Stations from CH 7825M to CH 18212M on the East-West Corridor of Nagpur Metro Rail Project.

3. GYT-TPL JV gave its bid for the contract but NMRCL, by an e-mail dated 23rd July, 2016 communicated to GYT-TPL JV that its bid was disqualified at the technical bid opening. The comment/remark relating to the disqualification stated that the documents submitted by GYT-TPL JV do not meet the eligibility conditions as stipulated in Clause 4.2(a) of Section III of the bid documents.

4. The controversy on the eligibility of GYT-TPL JV arises in view of Clause 4.2(a) of Section III of the tender conditions which reads inter alia as follows:

5. According to GYT-TPL JV, it had executed the Pearl River Delta intercity high speed railway project in China; it had received INR 3200 million from that project and it had constructed a viaduct of 7.284 km length under that contract. Before the High Court and before us, there was no controversy that GYT-TPL JV had received a minimum of INR 3200 million from its Pearl River Delta Intercity High Speed Railway Project and that whether it had completed a viaduct having a length of not less than 5 km. The sole question before the High Court was whether the Pearl River Delta Intercity High Speed Railway Project met the requirement of a 'metro civil construction work'. According to NMRCL, an inter-city high speed railway project did not meet the requirements of a metro civil construction work.

6. The High Court disagreed with NMRCL in the following words:

The civil construction work completed by the Petitioner [GYT-TPL JV] in terms of condition No. 4.2(a) was for an intercity high speed railway project in China and in the said contract, the Petitioner had completed a viaduct of 7.284 km length....The Petitioner has admittedly constructed a viaduct of not less than 5 km for the prestigious Pearl River Delta Intercity high speed railway project in China. We find on a reading of the tender conditions and particularly Clause 4.2(a) thereof that a contractor or a joint venture company is required to have the experience in Metro Civil Construction work and of completing a viaduct having a length of not less than 5 kms. We do not appreciate the submission on behalf of the Respondent that since the Petitioner had constructed the viaduct for a high speed railway project, the Petitioner would not have the experience of constructing a viaduct for a metro. It is not disputed by the Respondent that 'metro' would mean a railway or an underground railway. If that be so, we fail to fathom as to why the technical bid of the Petitioner was disqualified though the Petitioner has constructed a viaduct for Pearl River Delta Intercity high speed railway project in China of the length of 7.284 km. In our view, the Petitioner has the experience of constructing a viaduct of not less than 5 kms. in length in a Metro Civil Construction work contract and had also received more than INR 3200 million for satisfactorily completing the said contract. The distinction sought to be made by the Respondent NMRCL between the construction of a viaduct for Intercity High Speed Railway Project and the construction of a viaduct for the metro rail project, is illusory and not real. The action on the part of the NMRCL of disqualifying the Petitioner's technical bid is clearly arbitrary and is liable to be set aside.....

7. There is no dispute before us that the Metro Railway (Construction of Works) Act, 1978 and The Metro Railways (Operation and Maintenance) Act, 2002 extend to Nagpur and are applicable to the Nagpur Metro Rail Project. The expression 'metro railways' has been defined in Section 2(i) of the Metro Railways (Construction of Works) Act, 1978 in the following words:

(i) ""metro railway"" means a metro railway or any portion thereof for the public carriage of passengers, animals or goods and includes,--

(a) all land within the boundary marks indicating the limits of the land appurtenant to a metro railway.

(b) all lines of rails, sidings, yards or branches worked over for the purposes of, or in connection with, a metro railway,

(c) all stations, offices, ventilation shafts and ducts, warehouses, workshops, manufactories, fixed plants and machineries, sheds, depots and other works constructed for the purpose of, or in connection with, a metro railway;

A clearer definition is to be found in The Metro Railways (Operation and Maintenance) Act, 2002 in Section 2(i) thereof and this reads as follows:

(i) ""metro railway"" means rail-guided mass rapid transit system having dedicated right-of-way, with steel wheel or rubber-tyred wheel coaches, but excluding tramways, for carriage of passengers, and includes--

(A) all land within the boundary marks indicating the limits of the land appurtenant to a metro railway,

(B) all rail tracks, sidings, yards or branches worked over for the purposes of, or in connection with, a metro railway,

(C) all stations, offices, ventilation shafts and ducts, warehouses, workshops, manufactories, fixed plants and machineries, sheds, depots and other works constructed for the purpose of, or in connection with, a metro railway;

8. In view of the extension of these two statutes to the city of Nagpur, there can be no doubt that the definition of 'metro railway' or 'metro' would apply to the tender conditions floated for the purposes of the metro rail project of NMRCL.

9. It is submitted before us that an inter-city rail is completely different from a metro rail. An inter-city rail is between two cities and the trains are usually high speed trains. A metro rail is intra-city, it has a dedicated right-of-way, normally it does not have high speed trains and the frequency of trains is much greater that of inter-city trains.1 A metro rail may extend, in some cases, to a suburb of a metropolitan city but it essentially remains an intra-city project. There is, therefore, a qualitative difference between an inter-city rail and a metro rail. By itself, this indicates a qualitative difference in a railway project that is inter-city and a railway project that is intra-city and the construction of a viaduct for a railway project that is inter-city and a railway project that is intra-city.

10. The fact that GYT-TPL JV made constructions in a metropolitan city or in a metropolitan area during the execution of the Pearl River Delta inter-city high speed railway project, does not make that project an intra-city metro rail project-it continues to be an inter-city railway project. However, it not necessary for us to delve into these issues or even adjudicate on them.

11. Recently, in Central Coalfields Ltd. v. SLL-SML (Joint Venture Consortium) MANU/SC/0919/2016MANU/SC/0919/2016 : 2016(8) SCALE 99 it was held by this Court, relying on a host of decisions that the decision making process of the employer or owner of the project in accepting or rejecting the bid of a tenderer should not be interfered with. Interference is permissible only if the decision making process is mala fide or is intended to favour someone. Similarly, the decision should not be interfered with unless the decision is so arbitrary or irrational that the Court could say that the decision is one which no responsible authority acting reasonably and in accordance with law could have reached. In other words, the decision making process or the decision should be perverse and not merely faulty or incorrect or erroneous. No such extreme case was made out by GYT-TPL JV in the High Court or before us.

12. In Dwarkadas Marfatia and Sons v. Board of Trustees of the Port of Bombay MANU/SC/0330/1989MANU/SC/0330/1989 : (1989) 3 SCC 293 it was held that the constitutional Courts are concerned with the decision making process. Tata Cellular v. Union of India MANU/SC/0002/1996MANU/SC/0002/1996 : (1994) 6 SCC 651 went a step further and held that a decision if challenged (the decision having been arrived at through a valid process), the constitutional Courts can interfere if the decision is perverse. However, the constitutional Courts are expected to exercise restraint in interfering with the administrative decision and ought not to substitute its view for that of the administrative authority. This was confirmed in Jagdish Mandal v. State of Orissa MANU/SC/0090/2007MANU/SC/0090/2007 : (2007) 14 SCC 517 as mentioned in Central Coalfields.

13. In other words, a mere disagreement with the decision making process or the decision of the administrative authority is no reason for a constitutional Court to interfere. The threshold of mala fides, intention to favour someone or arbitrariness, irrationality or perversity must be met before the constitutional Court interferes with the decision making process or the decision.

14. We must reiterate the words of caution that this Court has stated right from the time when Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority of India MANU/SC/0048/1979MANU/SC/0048/1979 : (1979) 3 SCC 489 was decided almost 40 years ago, namely, that the words used in the tender documents cannot be ignored or treated as redundant or superfluous-they must be given meaning and their necessary significance. In this context, the use of the word 'metro' in Clause 4.2(a) of Section III of the bid documents and its connotation in ordinary parlance cannot be overlooked.

15. We may add that the owner or the employer of a project, having authored the tender documents, is the best person to understand and appreciate its requirements and interpret its documents. The constitutional Courts must defer to this understanding and appreciation of the tender documents, unless there is mala fide or perversity in the understanding or appreciation or in the application of the terms of the tender conditions. It is possible that the owner or employer of a project may give an interpretation to the tender documents that is not acceptable to the constitutional Courts but that by itself is not a reason for interfering with the interpretation given.

16. In the present appeals, although there does not appear to be any ambiguity or doubt about the interpretation given by NMRCL to the tender conditions, we are of the view that even if there was such an ambiguity or doubt, the High Court ought to have refrained from giving its own interpretation unless it had come to a clear conclusion that the interpretation given by NMRCL was perverse or mala fide or intended to favour one of the bidders. This was certainly not the case either before the High Court or before this Court.

17. Under the circumstances, we find merit in the appeals filed by the Appellants and set aside the judgment and orders passed by the High Court and restore the decision of NMRCL to the effect that GYT-TPL JV was not eligible to bid for the contract under consideration.

18. Before we conclude, it is necessary to point out that the High Court was of opinion that the eligible bidders were not entitled to be either impleaded in the petition filed in the High Court by the ineligible bidder GYT-TPL JV or were not entitled to be heard. With respect, this is not the appropriate view to take in matters such as the present. There are several reasons for this, one of them being that there could be occasions (as in the present appeals) where an eligible bidder could bring to the notice of the owner or employer of the project that the ineligible bidder was ineligible for additional reasons or reasons that were not within the contemplation of the owner or employer of the project. It was brought to our notice by Afcons Infrastructure in these appeals that GYT-TPL JV did not have any experience in the construction of a viaduct by the segmental construction method and that the translations of documents in Mandarin language filed in the High Court were not true English translations. Submissions made by learned Counsel for Afcons Infrastructure in this regard are important and would have had a bearing on the decision in the writ petition filed in the High Court but since Afcons Infrastructure was not a party in the High Court, it could not agitate these issues in the writ petition but did so in the review petition which was not entertained. It is to avoid such a situation that it would be more appropriate for the constitutional Courts to insist on all eligible bidders being made parties to the proceedings filed by an unsuccessful or ineligible bidder.

19. We make it clear that we have not considered the submissions of learned Counsel for Afcons Infrastructure on the two issues of the segmental construction method and faulty translation of documents since they were not before the High Court and also because we do not find it necessary to adjudicate on them in the view that we have taken.

20. The appeals are allowed. The parties are left to bear their own costs.

V. Gopala Gowda, J.

1. Leave granted in the Special Leave Petitions.

2. The present appeals arise out of the common impugned judgment and order dated 01.05.2015 passed by the High Court of judicature at Hyderabad for the States of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in Writ Petition Nos. 1873 and 2882 of 2015, wherein it was held that the assets, properties and funds lying at the present location of the Andhra Pradesh State Education Council of Higher Education now belong exclusively to the Telangana State Education Council for Higher Education.

3. The relevant facts which are required for us to appreciate the rival legal contentions are stated in brief hereunder:

The Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education (hereinafter referred to as the ""APSC"") was constituted Under Section 3 of the Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education Act, 1988, to advise the State government in matters relating to Higher Education in the State and to oversee its development with Perspective Planning. The APSC continued carrying out the various functions assigned to it under the Act of 1988, including conducting common entrance examinations for various courses in the State of Andhra Pradesh.

4. On 02.06.2014, the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 (hereinafter referred to as the ""Reorganisation Act, 2014"") came into force, which bifurcated the existing State of Andhra Pradesh into two separate States, namely, the State of Andhra Pradesh and the State of Telangana. The statement of objects and reasons of the Act provides, inter alia, as under:

a) it provides for the territories of the two successor states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, and necessary provisions relating to representation in Parliament and State Legislatures, distribution of revenues, apportionment of assets and liabilities, mechanisms for the management and development of water resources, power and natural resources and other matters.

...

c) it provides that Hyderabad in the existing State of Andhra Pradesh shall be the common capital of both the successor States from the appointed day for a period not exceeding ten years, and puts in place legal and administrative measures to ensure that both the State Governments can function efficiently from the common capital....

Section 75 of the Reorganisation Act, 2014 provides as under:

75. Continuance of facilities in certain State institutions.

(1) The Government of the State of Andhra Pradesh or the State of Telangana, as the case may be, shall, in respect of the institutions specified in the Tenth Schedule to this Act, located in that State, continue to provide facilities to the people of the other State which shall not, in any respect, be less favorable to such people than what were being provided to them before the appointed day, for such period and upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon between the two State Governments within a period of one year from the appointed day or, if no agreement is reached within the said period, as may be fixed by order of the Central Government.

(2) The Central Government may, at any time within one year from the appointed day, by notification in the Official Gazette, specify in the Tenth Schedule referred to in Sub-section (1) any other institution existing on the appointed day in the States of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and, on the issue of such notification, such Schedule shall be deemed to be amended by the inclusion of the said institution therein.

APSC figures as item 27 in the Tenth Schedule to the Reorganisation Act, 2014. Thus, in terms of Section 75, APSC was required to continue its functions in respect of both the States, i.e. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana until an agreement was reached between the two successor States.

5. Vide G.O.M. No. 5 dated 02.08.2014, the Government of Telangana adapted the Act of 1988 in the following terms:

Whereas by Section 101 of the Andhra Pradesh Re-Organisation Act, 2014 (Central Act No. 6 of 2014), the appropriate Government i.e. the State of Telangana is empowered by order, to make such adaptations and modifications of any law (as defined in Section 2(f) of the Act)made before 02.06.2014, whether by way of repeal or amendment as may be necessary or expedient, for the purpose of facilitating the application of such law in the State of Telangana before expiration of two years from 02.06.2014; and thereupon every such law shall have effect subject to the adaptations and modifications so made until altered, repealed or amended by a competent Legislature or other Competent Authority;

And whereas, it has become necessary to adapt the Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education Act, 1988 and the Rules and Regulations made thereunder for the purpose of facilitating their application in relation to the State of Telangana....

Thus, the Telangana State Council of Higher Education (hereinafter referred to as the ""TSC"") came into existence to discharge the same functions for the State of Telangana as the APSC for the State of Andhra Pradesh.

6. Pursuant to the creation of the TSC, the Secretary to the Government, Higher Education (UE) Department, Telangana, wrote Letter No. 263/UE/2014-2 dated 05.09.2014, to the Principal Secretary to Government, Higher Education (UE) Department, Andhra Pradesh outlining a provisional allocation of assets as well as posts between the two States, in terms of the proposal already submitted by the APSC, to divide the assets in the ratio of population as 52:48, as provided for Under Section 2(h) of the Reorganisation Act, 2014. These were to include:

a) Distribution of posts in the ratio of 58:42

b) Allocation of fixed deposits

c) Allocation of bank balances in various accounts

d) Number of employees based on nativity

e) Number of vehicles

f) Number of equipments

g) Number of movable assets etc.

The details of the proposed allocation are provided as under:

Fixed Deposits

Bank Balances in various accounts

Cadre wise allocation of posts between APSCHE & TSCHE

Cadre wise posts to APSCHE & TSCHE

Number of employees based on nativity

(only Council employees)

Number of vehicles (working and condemned)

Number of Equipments

Number of Movable Assets

7. On 30.10.2014, the Government of Telangana issued a Circular Memo to the senior management of the banks in which the bank accounts of the government were operating to ensure that the provisions of the Reorganization Act, 2014, especially with respect to the institutions listed in Schedules VII, IX and X were not violated. On 05.01.2015, TSC sent a communication to the Manager, Andhra Bank, Saifabad, Hyderabad Branch, stating that TSC is the successor organization to APSC as per the Reorganisation Act, 2014 and requested the Bank to freeze the operation of Account No. 0533100110978 and all other accounts operating in the name of APSC. The Bank sent a letter dated 07.01.2015 to APSC, informing them about the letter from TSC. In its reply dated 08.01.2015, APSC denied that TSC was its successor and informed the Bank that if it were to freeze its accounts, it would be constrained to take the appropriate legal action. Accordingly, the Bank sent a letter dated 14.01.2015 to the TSC declining to freeze the accounts of APSC. On 28.01.2015, the State Bank of Hyderabad, Shantinagar, Hyderabad Branch, without giving prior notice to APSC froze the accounts at the behest of TSC.

8. Aggrieved of the said action of the Bank in freezing the accounts, APSC filed Writ Petition No. 1873 of 2015 before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh, praying for the action of the State Bank of Hyderabad, Shantinagar, Hyderabad Branch in freezing the accounts of APSC to be declared as illegal, arbitrary and contrary to the principles of natural justice and setting it aside. The State of Telangana also filed Writ Petition No. 2882 of 2015 praying for a declaration that APSC and the State of Andhra Pradesh be not allowed to withdraw money from the bank accounts of APSC. By way of the impugned common judgment and order dated 01.05.2015, the High Court held that TSC would be allowed to operate the concerned bank accounts, and that the claim made by APSC was not sustainable since it was now located in the State of Telangana. The High Court held as under:

6. It is the settled position of law that institutions located in the successor States are governed by the law of successor State-laws of the land namely, principle of land, known as lex situs.

7. Under Article 246 (2) & (3) of the Constitution of India, the State Legislatures are competent to make laws in respect of their territory covered by the entries in List-II & III of the 7th schedule of the Constitution. Therefore, in terms of Section 75 of the Act, 2014, the specified institutions under the tenth schedule are governed by the laws of the respective States where they are located. Having regard to the aforesaid legal position, the institutions specified in the tenth schedule located in Telangana are governed by the law of the State of Telangana.

8...The office of institution of Petitioner No. 2 formerly known as APSC, is now situated in the State of Telangana at Hyderabad. Therefore, the law enacted by the State of Telangana alone, necessarily, has application for administration of the institution. Consequently, any action taken or order now passed by the erstwhile body of the institution specified at Item No. 27 of tenth schedule is without jurisdiction and would be ultra vires.

9. The APSC, at the instance of the State of Andhra Pradesh, is now asserting its power and authority and physically occupying the premises without any authority of law. The APSC is not entitled to operate the bank accounts or withdraw any amount. Notwithstanding the aforesaid legal status, even after 2nd June 2014, the APSC has withdrawn considerable amounts from the State Bank of Hyderabad, Shantinagar Branch, in respect of the above two saving bank accounts. As such, the Petitioner No. 2 wrote a letter to the State Bank of Hyderabad and Andhra Bank for freezing of the said accounts. Accordingly, a decision was taken by the Bank and rightly so.

(Emphasis laid by this Court)

On the question of ownership and control of the erstwhile APSC, the High Court held as under:

38. On a fair reading of Section 5 of the Act, 2014, as correctly contended by the learned A.G. for the state of Telangana, the State of Andhra Pradesh is a mere user of the city of Hyderabad for a maximum period of ten years. It has no proprietary right, title and interest in this city and none of the assets which belong to the erstwhile State of Andhra Pradesh, located at Hyderabad, can be claimed by the State of Andhra Pradesh except in accordance with the Act, 2014....

XXX

40...Because of the adaptation with amendments in the eye of law, APSC has no existence, at least in Hyderabad, or in any part of Telangana State...

41. Under such circumstances, the assets and properties and funds whatever lying at the present location of the APSC belong to TSC.

The High Court held that the claim made by APSC is not sustainable in law and that present TSC be allowed to operate the bank accounts of the erstwhile APSC. Hence, the present appeals filed by the State of Andhra Pradesh and APSC.

9. Mr. P.P. Rao, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the APSC, contends that it is essential to first understand the correct purport of Section 75 of the Reorganisation Act, 2014. Section 75 (extracted above) deals only with the continuance of facilities in respect of the Institutions specified in the Tenth Schedule. It can, by no means, be stretched to deal with either 'apportionment of assets and liabilities' of the Institutions specified in Tenth Schedule of the Reorganisation Act, 2014 or allocation of the Institutions to one State or the other.

10. The learned senior counsel contends that the assets and liabilities of the existing State are dealt with in Part-VI, consisting Sections 47-67 of the Reorganisation Act, 2014, under heading 'apportionment of assets and liabilities'.

Section 47 of the Reorganisation Act, 2014 reads as under:

47. (1) The provisions of this Part shall apply in relation to the apportionment of the assets and liabilities of the existing State of Andhra Pradesh immediately before the appointed day.

XXX

(3) The apportionment of assets and liabilities shall be subject to such financial adjustment as may be necessary to secure just, reasonable and equitable apportionment of the assets and liabilities amongst the successor States.

(4) Any dispute regarding the amount of financial assets and liabilities shall be settled through mutual agreement, failing which by order by the Central Government on the advice of the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India.

(Emphasis laid by this Court)

Further, Section 49, which deals with Treasury and Bank Balances, reads as under:

49. The total of the cash balances in all treasuries of the existing State of Andhra Pradesh and the credit balances of the existing State of Andhra Pradesh with the Reserve Bank of India, the State Bank of India or any other bank immediately before the appointed day shall be divided between the States of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana on the basis of population ratio....

Population ratio has been defined in Section 2(h) as under:

2.

(h) ""population ratio"", in relation to the States of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, means the ratio of 58.32: 41.68 as per 2011 Census

The learned senior counsel contends that the assets of APSC need to be divided in the population ratio between the successor States of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in a fair and equitable manner.

11. Mr. Basava Prabhu S. Patil, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the State of Andhra Pradesh contends that the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court is erroneous in law. The learned senior counsel contends that the funds collected by APSC post the creation of Telangana, i.e., post 02.06.2014 cannot be appropriated by the State of Telangana simply by way of the order of the High Court, on the basis of faulty interpretation of the provisions of the Reorganisation Act, 2014. It is submitted that this has effectively resulted in the State of Telangana stopping the State of Andhra Pradesh from utilising the funds it had collected even post the bifurcation, in respect of the thirteen districts which formed part of its territory. The learned senior counsel further draws our attention to Section 64 of the Reorganisation Act, 2014, which reads as under:

64. Residuary Provision: The benefit or burden of any asset or liability of the existing State of Andhra Pradesh not dealt with in the foregoing provisions of this Part shall pass to the State of Andhra Pradesh in the first instance, subject to such financial adjustment as may be agreed upon between the States of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana or, in default of such agreement, as the Central Government may, by order, direct.

(Emphasis laid by this Court)

12. The learned senior counsel further contends that the impugned judgment and order has been passed on a faulty consideration of the provisions of Sections 5, 75 and 101 of the Reorganisation Act, 2014, and in ignorance and non consideration of the provisions of Part VI of the Act, which deal with apportionment of assets and liabilities. The learned senior counsel contends that the overarching principle of the Reorganisation Act, 2014 is a twofold basis of bifurcation, namely reasonableness and equity, and population ratio, and the same must be implemented in its true spirit.

13. On the other hand, Mr. T.R. Andhyarujina, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the State of Telangana contends that the term 'facilities' used in Section 75 of the Reorganisation Act, 2014 should also be understood to include assets and liabilities of those respective institutions. If an institution falls within the territory of Telangana, then it cannot be disturbed, and the new State of Andhra Pradesh cannot stake any claim in it whatsoever.

14. Mr. K. Ramakrishna Reddi, learned Advocate General for the State of Telangana contends that the specified institutions in the tenth Schedule of the Reorganisation Act, 2014 are partly corporate personalities, in the nature of state owned institutions, without any commercial element and are non-profit in nature. The learned Advocate General places reliance on the decision of this Court in the case of Electricity Employees Union v. Union of India MANU/SC/0538/2000MANU/SC/0538/2000 : (2000) 7 SCC 339, wherein this Court, while interpreting the provisions of the Punjab Reorganisation Act held as under:

11. Part VI of the Act as stated above deals with apportionment of assets and liabilities of the erstwhile State of Punjab. This Part is not applicable for apportionment of assets and liabilities of the existing Punjab State Electricity Board, as there is specific provision for this purpose viz., Section 67 and moreover the Board has a separate legal entity.

15. Further, the learned Advocate General contends that the apportionment of assets and liabilities as per the Reorganisation Act, 2014 has been made on the basis of territory and location. The Tenth Schedule state institutions have to be maintained as per the location of the respective States. Thus, purely on the basis of the principle of territoriality also, the funds and assets of the erstwhile APSC now belong to the TSC.

16. Mr. Ranjit Kumar, the learned Solicitor General appearing on behalf of Union of India, submits that APSC is a statutory body constituted under the Andhra Pradesh State Council for Higher Education Act, 1988. Since the Council has to discharge statutory responsibilities under the relevant Act, both the States should adopt the Act of 1988 Under Section 101 of the Reorganisation Act, 2014, in the interest of students, till such time as they enact their own laws. While the government of Telangana has already adopted this, the Government of Andhra Pradesh is still to do so. The learned Solicitor General further submits that the ownership and division of the assets of the erstwhile APSC would be governed by Section 47 of the Reorganisation Act, 2014.

17. The learned Solicitor General draws our attention to a crucial provision which governs the assets and liabilities of the institutions incorporated under Central or State Act, i.e. Section 52(4), which reads as under:

52(4) Where anybody corporate constituted under a Central Act, State Act or Provincial Act for the existing State of Andhra Pradesh or any part thereof has, by virtue of the provisions of Part II, become an inter-State body corporate, the investments in, or loans or advances to, any such body corporate by the existing State of Andhra Pradesh made before the appointed day shall, save as otherwise expressly provided by or under this Act, be divided between the States of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in the same proportion in which the assets of the body corporate are divided under the provisions of this Part.

(Emphasis laid by this Court)

The learned Solicitor General further submits that since all statutory corporations and Public Sector Undertakings are the instrumentalities created by the existing State of Andhra Pradesh in the context of reorganization of the existing State, their assets and liabilities are liable to be apportioned between the two States as per the population ratio stipulated under the provisions of Section 2(h) of the Reorganisation Act, 2014. The APSC, being an asset of the existing State, created by the Act of 1988, it became necessary to provide for bifurcation of APSC and allocation of fixed deposits, Bank balances, cadre strength, vehicles, equipment, movable assets etc. The learned senior counsel submits that subsequent to the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court, TSC has been operating the bank accounts of APSC, which includes the money collected from the thirteen districts of the successor State of Andhra Pradesh.

18. We have heard the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the parties. The short point which arises for our consideration is whether the High Court was right in upholding the action of the Banks in freezing the accounts of APSC.

19. We are unable to agree with the contentions advanced by the learned senior counsel appearing for the State of Telangana.

20. The Constitution of India envisages a federal feature, which has been held to be a part of the basic structure of the Constitution of India, as has been held by the seven Judge Bench of this Court in the case of S.R. Bommai and Ors. v. Union of India MANU/SC/0444/1994MANU/SC/0444/1994 : (1994) 3 SCC 1, wherein Justice K. Ramaswamy in his concurring opinion elaborated as under:

247. Federalism envisaged in the Constitution of India is a basic feature in which the Union of India is permanent within the territorial limits set in Article 1 of the Constitution and is indestructible. The State is the creature of the Constitution and the law made by Articles 2 to 4 with no territorial integrity, but a permanent entity with its boundaries alterable by a law made by Parliament. Neither the relative importance of the legislative entries in Schedule VII, Lists I and II of the Constitution, nor the fiscal control by the Union per se are decisive to conclude that the Constitution is unitary. The respective legislative powers are traceable to Articles 245 to 254 of the Constitution. The State qua the Constitution is federal in structure and independent in its exercise of legislative and executive power. However, being the creature of the Constitution the State has no right to secede or claim sovereignty. Qua the Union, State is quasi-federal. Both are coordinating institutions and ought to exercise their respective powers with adjustment, understanding and accommodation to render socio-economic and political justice to the people, to preserve and elongate the constitutional goals including secularism.

248. The preamble of the Constitution is an integral part of the Constitution. Democratic form of Government, federal structure, unity and integrity of the nation, secularism, socialism, social justice and judicial review are basic features of the Constitution.

(Emphasis laid by this Court)

21. Article 3 of the Constitution of India confers the power of formation of new states on the Parliament. The scope of Article 3 was elaborated upon by a five judge bench of this Court in the case of Raja Ram Pal v. Hon'ble Speaker, Lok Sabha MANU/SC/0241/2007MANU/SC/0241/2007 : (2007) 3 SCC 184 as under:

India is an indestructible Union of destructible units. Article 3 and Article 4 of the Constitution together empower Parliament to make laws to form a new State by separation of the territory from any State or by uniting two or more States or parts of States or by uniting any territory to a part of any State, and in so doing to increase or diminish the area of any State and to alter its boundaries....

22. The issue of bifurcation of states is both sensitive as well as tricky. Adequate care has to be taken by the legislature while drafting legislations such as the Reorganisation Act, 2014 to ensure a smooth division of all assets, liabilities and funds between the states to make sure that the interests of the citizens living in these states are protected adequately. Therefore, care must be taken to ensure that no discrimination is done against either of the successor state. Thus while interpreting statutes of such nature, the courts must ensure that all parts of the statute are given effect to. An eleven Judge Bench of this Court in the case of H.H. Maharajadhiraja Madhav Rao Jivaji Rao Scindia Bahadur of Gwalior and Ors. v. Union of India MANU/SC/0050/1970MANU/SC/0050/1970 : (1971) 1 SCC 85 has held as under:

The Court will interpret a statute as far as possible, agreeably to justice and reason and that in case of two or more interpretations, one which is more reasonable and just will be adopted, for there is always a presumption against the law maker intending injustice and unreason. The Court will avoid imputing to the Legislature an intention to enact a provision which flouts notions of justice and norms of fairplay, unless a contrary intention is manifest from words plain and unambiguous. A provision in a statute will not be construed to defeat its manifest purpose and general values which animate its structure. In an avowedly democratic polity, statutory provisions ensuring the security of fundamental human rights including the right to property will, unless the contrary mandate be precise and unqualified, be construed liberally so as to uphold the right. These rules apply to the interpretation of Constitutional and statutory provisions alike.

(Emphasis laid by this Court)

23. In the case of Prakash Kumar @ Prakash Bhutto v. State of Gujarat MANU/SC/0030/2005MANU/SC/0030/2005 : (2005) 2 SCC 409, a constitution bench of this Court held as under:

By now it is well settled Principle of Law that no part of a statute and no word of a statute can be construed in isolation. Statutes have to be construed so that every word has a place and everything is in its place. It is also trite that the statute or rules made thereunder should be read as a whole and one provision should be construed with reference to the other provision to make the provision consistent with the object sought to be achieved.

In Reserve Bank of India v. Peerless General Finance and Investment Co. Ltd. this Court said:

33. Interpretation must depend on the text and the context. They are the basis of interpretation. One may well say if the text is the texture, context is what gives the colour. Neither can be ignored. Both are important. That interpretation is best which makes the textual interpretation match the contextual. A statute is best interpreted when we know why it was enacted. With this knowledge, the statute must be read, first as a whole and then section by section, clause by clause, phrase by phrase and word by word. If a statute is looked at, in the context of its enactment, with the glasses of the statute-maker, provided by such context, its scheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context. With these glasses we must look at the Act as a whole and discover what each section, each clause, each phrase and each word is meant and designed to say as to fit into the scheme of the entire Act. No part of a statute and no word of a statute can be construed in isolation. Statutes have to be construed so that every word has a place and everything is in its place.

(Emphasis laid by this Court)

24. It is natural that when an existing State if bifurcated to form two new States, there must be an equitable bifurcation of the assets and liabilities of the statutory bodies among the two successor States as well, to ensure welfare of the public at large residing within these territories.

25. In the instant case, the State of Telangana has claimed ownership over the entire funds and assets of the (erstwhile) APSC. This could surely not have been the intention of the legislature while enacting the Reorganisation Act, 2014. The main thrust of the argument of both the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of State of Telangana, as well as the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court is that the successor State of Andhra Pradesh has absolutely no right over the institutions in the city of Hyderabad, by virtue of the fact that Hyderabad falls in the successor State of Telangana. Heavy reliance has also been placed on Section 75 of the Reorganisation Act, 2014, on the ground that the assets belonging to the specified institutions of the Tenth Schedule exclusively belong to the State institutions, since the Act does not provide any apportionment to them. We are wholly unable to agree with this contention advanced on behalf of the State of Telangana. If this contention is accepted, it would render Section 47 of the Act, which provides for the apportionment of assets and liabilities among the successor States, useless and nugatory.

26. The action of the Banks of freezing the bank accounts of APSC is wholly untenable in law, which must be set aside. By no stretch of imagination can it be assumed that the complete takeover of assets of the erstwhile APSC by TSC, on the ground that the State institution happens to be in Hyderabad, which is now a part of Telangana, was what the legislature had in contemplation while enacting the Reorganisation Act, 2014.

27. For the reasons stated supra, the common impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court of judicature at Hyderabad for the States of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in Writ Petition Nos. 1873 and 2882 of 2015, upholding the freezing of the bank accounts of APSC being unsustainable in law is liable to be set aside and set aside. Accordingly, the appeals filed by the State of Andhra Pradesh and APSC are allowed.

28. Having allowed the appeal filed by APSC, we also hold that the action of freezing of the bank accounts of APSC is bad in law on account of the fact that what has been frozen is not just the pre bifurcation amount, but also the amounts collected by APSC for the period after the bifurcation in relation to the thirteen districts of the successor State of Andhra Pradesh. Accordingly, APSC must be allowed to operate their bank accounts in respect of the thirteen districts which fall within State of Andhra Pradesh now, in which the amounts collected post the date of bifurcation have been deposited. The assets of APSC of the undivided State of Andhra Pradesh, that is, assets existing up to the date of bifurcation may be divided between the two successor States in the population ratio of 58:42, as provided Under Section 2(h) of the Reorganisation Act, 2014, if the two successor States are agreeable to the same. If the two successor States are unable to arrive at an agreement, the Central Government may constitute a committee, which may be directed to arrive at an agreement, in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganisation Act, 2014 within a period of two months from the date such representation is made to the Central Government.

29. All pending applications are disposed of. No costs.

"S/ORDERS PASSED BY THE HIGH COURTS IN WRIT PETITIONS FILED AS PIL

Prior History:

From the Judgment and Order dated 11.07.2013 of the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad in Writ Petition (PIL) No. 144 of 2011 with Writ Petition (PIL) 13 of 2013

Disposition:

Disposed off

Citing Reference:

Mentioned

Case Note:
Civil - Illegal encroachment - Removal and Demolition - Direction thereof - Section 258 of Gujarat Municipalities Act, 1963 - Respondent No. 1 had filed petition seeking direction to State Authorities to remove illegal encroachment and structure erected by Appellant on Municipal Land and on public road and the surrounding area - High Court noticed that besides structure referred, there were in all 869 leases given by Municipality without authority of law - High Court issued directions to Collector to take possession of property after removing illegal occupants and demolition of existing structure - Hence, present appeal - Whether direction given by High Court to Collector transcended beyond mandate of Section 258 of Act

Facts:

The Respondent No. 1 had filed a petition for issuance of direction against Respondent No. 3 to 5/State Authorities to remove the illegal encroachment and structure erected by the Appellant on a Municipal Land and on the public road and the surrounding area. The High Court noticed that besides the structure referred, there were in all 869 leases given by the Municipality to different persons without authority of law and on which constructions have been put up without any formal lease executed. The Division Bench held that ordinarily public streets must be used by the Municipality as public streets for the public right of way and could not be let out or allowed to be used for any other purpose. The High Court issued directions to the Collector to take possession of the property after removing the illegal occupants of the same and demolition of the existing structure. It was held that the illegal occupants or the lessees cannot have any protection under the law. Hence, the present appeal filed by the Appellant.

Held, while disposing off the appeal:

(i) No formal lease was executed in favour of the Appellant or similarly placed persons for allotting the subject plot of land. Further, no prior permission was obtained from the State Government before allotting any portion of the municipal land or public property, much less on the land earmarked as public street. The fact that a resolution was passed by the Executive Committee of the Municipality or a letter of allotment was issued by the Municipality, could not legitimize the occupation of a public property in absence of a formal lease deed executed in that behalf and moreso in respect of a land falling within the public street. The direction issued by the High Court did not merit any interference. [7],[8] and[9]

(ii) The Municipality is obliged to restore the public property as it had originally existed, if such direction is issued by the Collector. The direction given by the High Court to take possession of the concerned property and remove illegal occupants therefrom and to demolish the unauthorized structure was not in derogation of the Section 258 of the Gujarat Municipalities Act, 1963 and particularly when the Collector was expected to exercise that power by following due process. [11]

(iii) For that the State Government must evolve a comprehensive policy, if already not in existence; and thereafter the Collector may proceed to take action in respect of such unauthorized occupation and encroachment on the public property. If such a policy is already in place then the Collector may proceed in conformity with the existing policy. [12] and[13]

(iv) The State Government would be free to consider the request of the occupants of unauthorized structures on the subject public property including to ratify the resolution passed in their favour by the Executive Committee of the Respondent-Municipality, provided it is in conformity with the expounded policy. [15]

1. This Court on 18th November, 2015, after hearing learned Counsel for the parties, had issued certain directions. Thereafter, the Court observed thus:

Learned Counsel appearing for both the sides are at liberty to file affidavits which may contain the data of the dog bites and the steps taken by the local bodies with regard to destruction/removal of the stray dogs. They are also at liberty to file data pertaining to population of stray dogs. The local authorities shall file affidavits including what kind of infrastructures they have provided, as required under the law. Needless to emphasize, no innovative method or subterfuge should be adopted not to carry out the responsibility under the 1960 Act or the 2001 Rules. Any kind of laxity while carrying out statutory obligations, is not countenanced in law.

A copy of the order passed today be sent to the Chief Secretary of each of the States and the competent authority of Union Territories, so that they can follow the same in letter and spirit.

In pursuance of our order, the State of Orissa, the New Delhi Municipal Council (N.D.M.C), South Delhi Municipal Corporation and the Bombay Municipal Corporation (B.M.C.) have filed their responses. It is submitted by Mr. Shekhar Naphade, learned senior Counsel appearing for the B.M.C. that Under Section 9(h) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, (for short, 'the Act') the Animal Welfare Board (for short, 'the Board') is to cooperate with the local authorities. Section 9, as has been stated in the earlier orders, deals with the functions of the Board. Clause (h) of Section 9 of the Act reads as follows:

9(h) to co-operate with, and co-ordinate the work of, associations or bodies established for the purpose of preventing unnecessary pain or suffering to animals or for the protection of animals and birds.

2. It is urged by Mr. Naphade, learned senior Counsel that the Board works with the aid and assistance of Animal Welfare Organization, which has been defined under Rule 2(b) of the Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules, 2001 (for short, 'the Rules'). Rule 6 of the aforesaid Rules read as under:

6. Obligations of the local authority.- (1) The local authority shall provide for-

(a) establishment of a sufficient number of dogs pounds including animal kennels/shelters which may be managed by animal welfare organizations;

(b) requisite number of dogs vans with ramps for the capture and transportation of street dogs;

(c) one driver and two trained dog catchers to be provided for each dog van;

(d) an ambulance-cum-clinical van to be provided as mobile center for sterilization and immunisation;

(e) incinerators to be installed by the local authority for disposal of carcasses.

(f) periodic repair of shelter or pound.

(2) If the Municipal Corporation or the local authority thinks it expedient to control street dog population, it shall be incumbent upon them to sterilize and immunise street dogs with the participation of animal welfare organizations, private individuals and the local authority.

(3) The animal welfare organizations shall be reimbursed the expenses of sterilisation/immunisation at a rate to be fixed by the Committee on fortnightly basis based on the number of sterilisation/immunisation done.

(4) The Monitoring committee of the said locality shall meet at least once in every month to assess the progress made in regard to implementation of the Animal Birth Control Programme.

3. Submission of Mr. Naphade is that it is the duty of the Board and the Animal Welfare Organization to assist the local authorities and not to create impediment. We are sure that the Board and the Animal Welfare Organization shall act within the parameters of the Act and the Rules.

4. In course of hearing, we have been apprised that the real problem is the implementation of the Act and the"" Rules. Learned Counsel for the parties very fairly stated that the litigation is not adversarial, but the purpose is to see that the Acts and Rules are appositely implemented and the compassion to animals and the healthy existence of the human beings are seemly balanced.

5. We will be failing in our duty if we do not make a note of the submissions of both the sides which are extreme in nature, for example, emphasis and stress have been laid that due to stray dogs, there has been threat to life, health, movement and sometimes security of the human beings. On the other hand, it has been highlighted that the stray dogs are being annihilated without any justifiable reason. As advised at present, we do not intend to say anything on the said counts today.

6. On the last occasion, we had asked the Chief Secretary of each of the States and competent authorities of the Union Territories to act in letter and spirit of the previous order. As has been indicated earlier, responses have been filed by the State of Orissa, N.D.M.C, South Delhi Municipal Corporation and B.M.C., Mumbai. Considering the facts and circumstances in entirety, we direct the Chief Secretary of each of the States, either himself or through the Secretary of Health and the competent authorities of the Union Territories to send the report as regards the implementation of the Act and the Rules to the Board within six weeks hence. Ms. Anjali Sharma, learned Counsel appearing for the Animal Welfare Board, on receipt of the report, shall apprise Mr. Gopal Subramanium, learned senior Counsel appearing for the Animal Welfare Board and the Board shall file a module keeping in view the parameters of the Act and the Rules for appropriate implementation. Needless to emphasize, the Union of India shall be at liberty to work out the module. Learned Counsel appearing for the parties can also give their suggestions after the module is filed in Court.

7. The report submitted to the Board by the States and the other competent authorities shall be filed before this Court through their Standing Counsel. Copies of the writ petition and the special leave petitions shall be supplied to all the concerned by Ms. Anjali Sharma, learned Counsel appearing for the Animal Welfare Board. The order passed today along with the previous order be sent by the Registry of this Court to the Chief Secretaries of the States and the administrator of the Union Territories so that they can do the needful in the matter.

8. At this juncture, Mr. Dushyant A. Dave, learned senior Counsel has submitted that the said authorities should indicate in the report as to how many deaths have occurred due to dog bites and what steps have been taken. Additionally, it is suggested by him that the report must also indicate the number of sterilization that have taken place and the resources available on the said front. We direct all the authorities to include the same as a part of the same in the report.

9. As we have given time for the submission of report within six weeks, we give further four weeks time to file the module by the Board.

10. At this juncture, it is submitted by Mr. Rakesh Kumar, learned Counsel appearing for the South Delhi Municipal Corporation that they have a problem in dealing with the stray dogs because of certain communication received by the Delhi International Airport Private Limited (DIAL). Mr. P.S. Narasimha, learned Additional Solicitor General and Mr. Gopal Subramanium, learned senior Counsel appearing for the Board, shall see to it that the problem is sorted out.

11. We will be failing in our duty if we do not note the submission of Mr. Dushyant A. Dave that though the Act and Rules provide for sterilization of dogs so that safety of the human beings is not jeopardized, yet they are not being sterilized by the authorities, either for lack of funds or due to apathy. Regard being had to the provisions governing the field, we direct that the dogs which are required to be sterilized or vaccinated, the procedure shall be carried out in accordance with the Act and Rules and no organization shall create any kind of obstacle or impediment in the same. It shall be the obligation of the Board to oversee that this is being carried out and no obstructions are created in this regard from any quarter.

12. The copy of the module to be prepared by the Board, shall be given to the learned Counsel for the parties.

13. Let this matters be listed on 12th July, 2016.

I.A. No. 4 of 2015 in W.P.(C) No. 599 of 2015

14. Heard Mr. V.K. Biju, learned Counsel for the applicant. It is submitted by Mr. Biju that he has filed this interlocutory application keeping in view the miserable conditions of the families, who have suffered because of death of the breadwinner due to dog bite. Learned Counsel would submit that despite time being granted, the State of Kerala has not filed its response. Ms. Liz Mathew, learned Counsel appearing for the State of Kerala submits that she will file the reply in course of the day. Objection, if any, thereto be filed within three days hence.

Let this interlocutory application be listed on 18th March, 2016.

B.N. Kirpal, J.

1. Leave granted. The transfer petitions are allowed.

2. The challenge to the constitutional validity of The Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') on the ground that the Act is unreasonable and is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution, and that the same is beyond the legislative competence of the Parliament, arises for consideration in these cases.

3. The banks and financial institutions had been experiencing considerable difficulties in recovering loans and enforcement of securities charged with them. The procedure for recovery of debts due to the banks and financial institutions which was being followed had resulted in a significant portion of the funds being blocked. In order to remedy the locking up of huge funds, the Parliament enacted the said Act, which was preceded by an ordinance. The Act, inter alia, provides for the establishment of Tribunals and Appellate Tribunals. The Tribunals have been given the jurisdiction, powers and authority to entertain and decide applications from the banks and financial institutions for recovery of debts due to such banks and financial institutions, while the Appellate Tribunals have the jurisdiction, powers and authority to entertain appeals. The procedure which is required to be followed is provided and the Act also has provisions relating to the modes of recovery of debts for which Recovery Officers are to be appointed.

4. The jurisdiction of the Tribunals is in respect of debts which are in excess of Rs. 10 lacs. In other words, for disputes between the banks and the other parties it was the Civil Courts which have the jurisdiction to entertain the same if the claim was less than Rs. 10 lacs. According to Section 18 of the Act, no Court or other authority is entitled to exercise any jurisdiction, powers or authority in relation to matters in respect of which such jurisdiction, powers and authority are vested with the Tribunal. Section 18, however, provides that the bar of other Courts and authorities to entertain such disputes shall not in any way oust the jurisdiction of this Court or of the High Courts in exercise of their jurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution.

5. The validity of the said Act was successfully challenged before the Delhi High Court. By it's decision reported in Delhi High Court Bar Association and Another vs. Union of India and Others MANU/DE/0066/1995MANU/DE/0066/1995 : AIR1995Delhi323, against which appeal No. 4679 of 1995 is filed, the High Court held that though Tribunal could be constituted by Parliament even though it was not within the purview of Articles 323A and 323B of the Constitution, and that the expression ""administration of justice"" as appearing in Entry 11A of List III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution would include Tribunals as well administering justice; the impugned Act was unconstitutional as it erodes the independence of the judiciary and was irrational, discriminatory, unreasonable, arbitrary and was hit by Article 14 of the Constitution. In this judgment, it also quashed the appointment of a Presiding Officer of the Tribunal but that question no longer arises for consideration in these appeals.

6. In arriving at the aforesaid conclusion the Delhi High Court, inter alia, held as follows:

(a) The act, in particular, Section 17 did not have a provision for a counter-claim as provided under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and, therefore, the Act was irrational and arbitrary.

(b) The Act lowered the authority of the High Court vis--vis the Tribunal in view of the fact that suits for recovery of money exceeding Rs. 10 lacs are to be filed before the Tribunal while the suits for an amount between Rs. 5 lacs and Rs. 10 lacs was to be filed before the Delhi High Court and for less than Rs. 5 lacs before the subordinate Courts. This lowered the status of the High Court inasmuch as the Tribunal, which was presided by an officer who did not have the status of a High Court Judge would be deciding the suits for recovery of money exceeding Rs. 10 lacs.

(c) The Act eroded the independence of the judiciary since the jurisdiction of Civil Courts had been truncated and vested in the Tribunal. It also came to the conclusion that the independence of the judiciary was eroded as the High Court had no role to play in the appointment of the presiding officers.

7. During the pendency of this appeal, the Guwahati High Court was also required to consider the validity of this Act. By judgment dated 16.08.1999 to 20.08.1999, which is the subject-matter of Civil Appeal Nos. 6227-6246 of 2000, the High Court came to the conclusion that though the Parliament has legislative competence to enact the law, but as it had abrogated/negated the power of judicial review, which had violated the basic feature of the Constitution, the Act was void. It further held that some of the provisions of the impugned Act were liable to be struck off. The sections which were struck down were Section 17 which gives jurisdiction, powers and authority to the Tribunal and was held to be violative of Article 14 as being arbitrary and unreasonable. It also struck down the appointment of Recovery Officer and held the modes for recovery of debts under Sections 25 and 28(1) and (2) as being unarbitrary, unreasonable and without any guidelines, control etc. It further quashed Section 31 which deals with the transfer of suits/proceedings and Section 34(1) which gives overriding effect to the Act.

8. In the course of hearing, our attention was invited to a decision of the Karnataka High Court in the case of D.K. Abdul Khader and Others vs. Union of India and Others, AIR 2001 Karn 176 where a Single Judge of the High Court, while taking a different view from the one expressed by the Delhi High Court, came to the conclusion that the Parliament did not have the legislative competence to enact the Act inasmuch as Entry 11A of List III could not include ""Tribunal"" and furthermore that the Parliament could not exercise power to enact this law under the provisions of Article 323A or 323B of the Constitution. In other words, a Tribunal could not be constituted for any matter not specified in Articles 323A or 323B.

9. We will first deal with the question as to whether the Parliament has the competence to enact a law for establishing such Banking Tribunals. In order to examine the question of the competence of the Parliament to enact such a law, it is pertinent to bear in mind the observations of this Court in Navinchandra Mafatlal vs. The Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay City MANU/SC/0070/1954MANU/SC/0070/1954 : [1954]26ITR758(SC) which are as follows:

"".. As pointed out by Gwyer C.J. in The United Provinces v. Atiqa Begum MANU/FE/0003/1940MANU/FE/0003/1940 : 1940 F.C.R. 110 none of the items in the Lists is to be read in a narrow or restricted sense and that each general word should be held to extend to all ancillary or subsidiary matters which can fairly and reasonably be said to be comprehended in it. It is, therefore, clear-and it is acknowledged by Chief Justice Chagla-that in construing an entry in a List conferring legislative powers the widest possible construction according to their ordinary meaning must be put upon the words used therein. The cardinal rule of interpretation, however, is that words should be read in their ordinary, natural and grammatical meaning subject to this rider that in construing words in a constitutional enactment conferring legislative power the most liberal construction should be put upon the words so that the same may have effect in their widest amplitude.""

(Emphasis added)

10. Again in Union of India vs. H. S. Dhillon MANU/SC/0062/1971MANU/SC/0062/1971 : [1972]83ITR582(SC) : [1972]83ITR582(SC) it was observed as follows:

""It seems to us that the function of Art. 246(1), read with entries 1-96 List I, is to give positive power to Parliament to legislate in respect of these entries. Object is not to debar Parliament from legislating on a matter, even if other provisions of the Constitution enable it to do so.""

11. In Dhillon's decision, it was held that what one has to ask is whether the matter sought to be legislated is included in List II or in List III and no question has to be asked about List I. If the answer is in the negative, then it follows that the Parliament has power to make laws with respect to that matter or text.

12. It has thus been clearly enunciated that the power of the Parliament to enact a law, which is not covered by an Entry List II and List III, is absolute. While Articles 323A or 323B specifically enable the legislatures to enact laws for the establishment of tribunals, in relation to the matters specified therein, the power of the Parliament to enact a law constituting a Tribunal, like the Banking Tribunal, which is not covered by any of the matters specified in Article 323A or 323B, is not taken away. With regard to any of the entries specified in List I, the exclusive jurisdiction to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I is with the Parliament. The power conferred by Article 246(1) can be exercised notwithstanding the existence of Article 323A or 323B of the Constitution.

13. Articles 323A or 323B are enabling provisions which specifically enable the setting up of tribunals contemplated by the said Articles. These Articles, however, cannot be interpreted to mean that it prohibits the legislature from establishing tribunals not covered by these Articles, as long as there is legislative competence under an appropriate entry in the Seventh Schedule. Articles 323A or 323B do not take away that legislative competence. The contrary view expressed by the Karnataka High Court in D.K. Abdul Khader's case does not lay down the correct law and we expressly disapprove of the same.

14. The Delhi High Court and the Guwahati High Court have held that the source of the power of the Parliament to enact a law relating to the establishment of the Debt Recovery Tribunal is entry 11A of List III which pertains to ""administration of justice; Constitution and organisation of all Courts, except the Supreme Court and the High Courts"" In our opinion, entry 45 of List I would cover the types of legislation now enacted. Entry 45 of List I relates to ""Banking"". Banking operations would, inter alia, include accepting of loans and deposits, granting of loans and recovery of the debts due to the bank. There can be little doubt that under Entry 45 of List I, it is the Parliament alone which can enact a law with regard to the conduct of business by the banks. Recovery of dues is an essential function of any banking institution. In exercise of its legislative power relating to banking, the Parliament can provide the mechanism by which monies due to the Banks and Financial Institutions can be recovered. The Tribunals have been set up in regard to the debts due to the banks. The special machinery of a Tribunal which has been constituted as per the Preamble of the Act, ""for expeditious adjudication and recovery of debts due to banks and financial institutions and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto"" would squarely fall within the ambit of Entry 45 of List I. As none of the items in the lists are to be read in a narrow or restricted sense, the term ""Banking"" in Entry 45 would mean legislation regarding all aspects of Banking including ancillary or subsidiary matters relating to Banking. Setting up of an adjudicatory body like the Banking Tribunal relating to transactions in which banks and financial institutions are concerned would clearly fall under entry 45 of List I giving the Parliament specific power to legislate in relation thereto.

15. The learned counsel has drawn our attention to the provisions of the Act and we are unable to agree with the Delhi High Court that the Act or any other provision thereof is in any way arbitrary or bad in law. During the pendency of these appeals, the Act has been amended and whatever lacunae or infirmities existed have now been removed by the said Amending Act and with the framing of more Rules. For example, Rules have been framed in 1998 for the appointment of Presiding Officers of the Tribunals as well as the Presiding Officers of the Appellate Tribunals. The Rules contemplate appointments being made by a Selection Committee. Each of the Selection Committee is to consist of the Chief Justice of India or a Judge of the Supreme Court as nominated by the Chief Justice of India along with other members referred to in the said Rules. The Selection Committee so constituted would ensure fair and impartial selection of competent persons to act as Presiding Officers of the Tribunal. Furthermore Section 19 after its amendment reads as follows:

""19. Application to the Tribunal.- (1) Where a bank or a financial institution has to recover any debt from any person, it may make an application to the Tribunal within the local limits of whose jurisdiction-

(a) the defendant, or each of the defendants where there are more than one, at the time of making the application, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain; or

(b) any of the defendants where there are more than one, at the time of making the application, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain; or

(c) the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises.

(2) Where a bank or a financial institution, which has to recover its debt from any person, has filed an application to the Tribunal under sub-section (1) and against the same person another bank or financial institution also has a claim to recover its debt, then, the later bank or financial institution may join the applicant bank or financial institution at any stage of the proceedings, before the final order is passed, by making an application to the Tribunal.

(3) Every application under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) shall be in such form and accompanied by such documents or other evidence and by such fee as may be prescribed:

Provided that the fee may be prescribed having regard to the amount of debt to be recovered:

Provided further that nothing contained in this sub-section relating to fee shall apply to cases transferred to the Tribunal under sub-section (1) of Section 31.

(4) On receipt of the application under sub-section (1) or sub- section (2), the Tribunal shall issue summons requiring the defendant to show cause within thirty days of the service of summons as to why the relief prayed for should not be granted.

(5) The defendant shall, at or before the first hearing or within such time as the Tribunal may permit, present a written statement of his defence.

(6) Where the defendant claims to set-off against the applicant's demand any ascertained sum of money legally recoverable by him from such applicant, the defendant may, at the first hearing of the application, but not afterwards unless permitted by the Tribunal, present a written statement containing the particulars of the debt sought to be set-off.

(7) The written statement shall have the same effect as a plaint in a cross-suit so as to enable the Tribunal to pass a final order in respect both of the original claim and of the set-off.

(8) A defendant in an application may, in addition to his right of pleading a set-off under sub-section (6), set up, by way of counter-claim against the claim of the applicant, any right or claim in respect of a cause of action accruing to the defendant against the applicant either before or after the filing of the application but before the defendant has delivered his defence or before the time limited for delivering his defence has expired, whether such counter-claim is in the nature of a claim for damages or not.

(9) A counter-claim under sub-section (8) shall have the same effect as a cross-suit so as to enable the Tribunal to pass a final order on the same application, both on the original claim and on the counter claim.

(10) The applicant shall be at liberty to file a written statement in answer to the counter-claim of the defendant within such period as may be fixed by the Tribunal.

(11) Where a defendant sets up a counter-claim and the applicant contends that the claim thereby raised ought not to be disposed of by way of counter-claim but in an independent action, the applicant may, at any time before issues are settled in relation to the counter-claim, apply to the Tribunal for an order that such counter-claim may be excluded, and the Tribunal may, on the hearing of such application make such order as it thinks fit.

(12) The Tribunal may make an interim order (whether by way of injunction or stay or attachment) against the defendant to debar him from transferring, alienating or otherwise dealing with, or disposing of, any property and assets belonging to him without the prior permission of the Tribunal.

(13) (A) Where, at any stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal is satisfied, by affidavit or otherwise, that the defendant, with intent to obstruct or delay or frustrate the execution of any order for the recovery of debt that may be passed against him,-

(i) is about to dispose of the whole or any part of his property; or

(ii) is about to remove the whole or any part of his property from the local limits of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal; or

(iii) is likely to cause any damage or mischief to the property or affect its value by misuse or creating third party interest,

the Tribunal may direct the defendant, within a time to be fixed by it, either to furnish security, in such sum as may be specified in the order, to produce and place at the disposal of the Tribunal, when required, the said property or the value of the same, or such portion thereof as may be sufficient to satisfy the certificate for the recovery of debt, or to appear and show cause why he should not furnish security.

(B) Where the defendant fails to show cause why he should not furnish security, or fails to furnish the security required, within the time fixed by the Tribunal, the Tribunal may order the attachment of the whole or such portion of the properties claimed by the applicant as the properties secured in his favour or otherwise owned by the defendant as appears sufficient to satisfy any certificate for the recovery of debt.

(14) The applicant shall, unless the Tribunal otherwise directs, specify the property required to be attached and the estimated value thereof.

(15) The Tribunal may also in the order direct the conditional attachment of the whole or any portion of the property specified under sub-section (14).

(16) If an order of attachment is made without complying with the provisions of sub-section (13), such attachment shall be void.

(17) In the case of disobedience of an order made by the Tribunal under sub-sections (12), (13) and (18) or breach of any of the terms on which the order was made, the Tribunal may order the properties of the person guilty of such disobedience or breach to be attached and may also order such person to be detained in the civil prison for a term not exceeding three months, unless in the meantime the Tribunal directs his release.

(18) Where it appears to the Tribunal to be just and convenient, the Tribunal may, by order,-

(a) appoint a receiver of any property, whether before or after grant of certificate for recovery of debt;

(b) remove any person from the possession or custody of the property;

(c) commit the same to the possession, custody or management of the receiver;

(d) confer upon the receiver all such powers, as to bringing and defending suits in the courts or filing and defending applications before the Tribunal and for the realization, management, protection, preservation and improvement of the property, the collection of the rents and profits thereof, the application and disposal of such rents and profits, and the execution of documents as the owner himself has, or such of those powers as the Tribunal thinks fit; and

(e) appoint a Commissioner for preparation of an inventory of the properties of the defendant or for the sale thereof.

(19) Where a certificate of recovery is issued against a company registered under the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956), the Tribunal may order the sale proceeds of such company to be distributed among its secured creditors in accordance with the provisions of Section 529A of the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956) and to pay the surplus, if any, to the company.

(20) The Tribunal may, after giving the applicant and the defendant an opportunity of being heard, pass such interim or final order, including the order for payment of interest from the date on or before which payment of the amount is found due up to the date of realisation or actual payment, on the application as it thinks fit to meet the ends of justice.

(21) The Tribunal shall send a copy of every order passed by it to the applicant and the defendant.

(22) The Presiding Officer shall issue a certificate under his signature on the basis of the order of the Tribunal to the Recovery Officer for recovery of the amount of debt specified in the certificate.

(23) Where the Tribunal, which has issued a certificate of recovery, is satisfied that the property is situated within the local limits of the jurisdiction of two or more Tribunals, it may send the copies of the certificate of recovery for execution to such other Tribunals where the property is situated:

Provided that in a case where the Tribunal to which the certificate of recovery is sent for execution find that it has no jurisdiction to comply with the certificate of recovery, it shall return the same to the Tribunal which has issued it.

(24) The application made to the Tribunal under sub-section 9(1) or sub-section (2) shall be dealt with by it as expeditiously as possible and endeavour shall be made by it to dispose of the application finally within one hundred and eighty days from the date of receipt of the application.

(25) The Tribunal may make such orders and give such directions as may be necessary or expedient to give effect to its orders or to prevent abuse of its process or to secure the ends of justice.""

16. The aforesaid section prescribes the manner in which an application to the Tribunal filed by a bank or a financial institution is to be dealt with. Section 22 provides that the Tribunal and the Appellate Tribunal shall not be bound by the procedure laid down by the Code of Civil Procedure, but shall be guided by the principles of natural justice and, subject to the rules framed. They shall have powers to regulate their own procedure as given to them. The Tribunal and the Appellate Tribunal under Section 22(2) are given the same powers as are vested in a civil court with regard to the matters specified in the said sub-section which include the power of summoning and enforcing the attendance of any person and examining him on oath.

17. The very purpose of establishing the Tribunal being to expedite the disposal of the applications filed by the banks and financial institutions for realisation of money, the Tribunal and the Appellate Tribunals are required to deal with the applications in an expeditious manner. It is precisely for this reason that Section 22(1) stipulates that the Tribunal and the Appellate Tribunal shall not be bound by the procedure laid down by the Code of Civil Procedure. Therefore even though the Tribunal can regulate its own procedure, the Act requires that any procedure laid down by it must be guided by the principles of natural justice while, at the same time, it should not regard itself as being bound by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.

18. On behalf of some of the respondents, it was contended that on a correct interpretation of Rule 12(6) of the Debts Recovery Tribunal (Procedure) Rules, 1993, wherever any party desires the production of a witness for cross-examination, then his evidence could not be taken by way of affidavit but it would be mandatory for the Tribunal to require the production of the witness. It was submitted that this provision is in pari materia with Order 19 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and the view taken by some of the Tribunals that a party does not have a right to cross-examine a witness, whose evidence is taken on affidavit, is not correct.

19. With the amendment of the Act in 2000 while a new Section 19 was inserted in place of the existing one, section 22 has not undergone any change and the same reads as follows:

""22. Procedure and powers of the Tribunal and the Appellate Tribunal-

(1) The Tribunal and the Appellate Tribunal shall not be bound by the procedure laid down by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) but shall be guided by the principles of natural justice and, subject to the other provisions of this Act and of any rules, the Tribunal and the Appellate Tribunal shall have powers to regulate their own procedure including the places at which they shall have their sittings.

(2) The Tribunal and the Appellate Tribunal shall have, for the purposes of discharging their functions under this Act, the same powers as are vested in a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), while trying a suit, in respect of the following matters, namely:-

(a) summoning and enforcing the attendance of any person and examining him on oath;

(b) requiring the discovery and production of documents;

(c) receiving evidence on affidavits;

(d) issuing commissions for the examination of witnesses or documents;

(e) reviewing its decisions;

(f) dismissing an application for default or deciding it ex parte;

(g) setting aside any order of dismissal of any application for default or any order passed by it ex parte;

(h) any other matter which may be prescribed.

(3) Any proceeding before the Tribunal or the Appellate Tribunal shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of Sections 193 and 228, and for the purposes of Section 196, of the Indian Penal Code and the Tribunal or the Appellate Tribunal shall be deemed to be civil court for all purposes of Section 195 and Chapter XXVI of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974).""

20. By a notification dated 19.6.1997, some of the rules contained in the Debts Recovery Tribunal (Procedure) Rules, 1993, were amended. It is not necessary to refer to all the amendments so made, but what is important is to examine Rule 12 which, after amendment, reads as follows:

""12. Filing of reply and other documents by the respondent (1) The defendant may file two complete sets containing the reply to the application along with documents in a paper book form with the registry within one month of the service of the notice of the filing of the application on him.

(2) The defendant shall also endorse one copy of the reply along with documents as mentioned in sub-rule (1) to the applicant.

(3) The Tribunal may, in its discretion on application by the defendant, allow the filing of reply referred to in sub-rule (1), after the expiry of the period referred to therein.

(4) If the defendant fails to file the reply under sub-rule (1) or on the date fixed for hearing of the application, the Tribunal may proceed forthwith to pass an order on the application as it thinks fit.

(5) Where a defendant makes an admission of the full or part of the amount of debt due to a bank or financial institution, the Tribunal shall order such defendant to pay the amount, to the extent of the admission, by the applicant within a period of one month from the date of such order failing which the Tribunal may issue a certificate in accordance with Section 19 of the Act to the extent of amount of debt due admitted by the defendant.

(6) The Tribunal may at any time for sufficient reason order that any particular fact or facts may be proved by affidavit, or that the affidavit of any witness may be read at the hearing, on such conditions as the Tribunal thinks reasonable:

Provided that where it appears to the Tribunal that either applicant or defendant desires the production of a witness for cross-examination, and that such witness can be produced an order shall not be made authorising the evidence of such witness to be given by affidavit.

(7) If the defendant denies his liability to pay the claim made by the applicant, the Tribunal may act upon the affidavit of the applicant who is acquainted with the facts of the case or who has on verification of the record sworn the affidavit in respect of the contents of application and the documents as evidence.

(8) Provisions contained in section 4 of the Bankers' Books Evidence Act, 1891 (18 of 1891) shall apply to a certified copy of an entry in a banker's book furnished along with the application filed under sub-section (1) of Section 19 by the applicant.""

21. As a result of the amendments made in the Act and the Rules, the position which would emerge is that Section 19(1) of the Act requires the filing of an application by a bank or a financial institution for the recovery of debt to be made before a Tribunal having territorial jurisdiction. On receipt of the application, summons are issued to the defendant who has to show cause within the stipulated period as to why the relief prayed for should not be granted. A right is now given by sub-section 6 of Section 19 to the defendant to claim a set-off against the applicant's demand and the said written statement is to have the same effect as a plaint in a cross-suit. Under sub-section 8 of Section 19, the defendant is also entitled to set-up a counter claim in addition to his right of claiming a set-off. Sub-section 20 of Section 19 provides that after giving the applicant and the defendant an opportunity of being heard, the Tribunal may pass such interim or final order as it thinks fit to meet the ends of justice. It is after this order that a certificate is issued by the Presiding Officer to the Recovery Officer for recovery of money. Section 22 of the Act has not been amended. Therefore, reading Sections 19 and 22 of the Act together, it appears that the Tribunal and the Appellate Tribunal are to be guided by the principles of natural justice while trying the matter before them. Section 22(1) of the Act stipulates that the Tribunal and the Appellate Tribunal, while being guided by the principles of natural justice, are to be subject to the other provisions of the Act and the Rules. Rule 12(7) provides that if a defendant denies his liability to pay the claim made by the applicant, the Tribunal may act upon the affidavit of the applicant who is acquainted with the facts of the case. In this Rule, which deals with the consideration of the applicant's bank application, there is no reference to the examination of witnesses. This sub-rule refers only to the affidavit of the applicant. Rule 12(6), on the other hand, provides that the Tribunal may, at any time, for sufficient reason order a fact to be proved by affidavit or may pass an order that the affidavit of any witness may be read at the hearing. It is in the proviso to this sub-rule that a reference is made to the cross- examination of witnesses.

22. At the outset, we find that the Rule 12 is not happily worded. The reason for establishing banking tribunals being to expedite the disposal of the claims by the banks, the Parliament thought it proper only to require the principles of natural justice to be the guiding factor for the Tribunals in deciding the applications, as is evident from Section 22 of the Act. While the Tribunal has, no doubt, been given the power of summoning and enforcing the attendance of any witness and examining him on oath, but the Act does not contain any provision which makes it mandatory for the witness to be examined, if such a witness could be produced. Rule 12(6) has to be read harmoniously with the other provisions of the Act and the Rules. As we have already noticed , Rule 12 (7) gives the Tribunal the power to act upon the affidavit of the applicant where the defendant denies his liability to pay the claims. Rule 12(6), if paraphrased, would read as follows:

1. The Tribunal may at any time for sufficient reason order that any particular fact or facts may be proved by affidavit.. on such conditions as the Tribunal thinks reasonable;

2. The Tribunal may at any time for sufficient reason order that the affidavit of any witness may be read at the hearing, on such conditions as the Tribunal thinks reasonable.

23. In other words, the Tribunal has the power to require any particular fact to be proved by affidavit, or it may order the affidavit of any witness may be read at the hearing"
"

B.P. Singh, J.

1. This appeal has been preferred by the three appellants herein i.e. Ram Anup Singh, Babban Singh and Lallan Singh. Ram Anup Singh is the father of Babban Singh and Lallan Singh. The appeal arises out of an incident that occurred on 27th March, 1997 in which four innocent lives were lost. Amongst the deceased were Madan Singh, brother of Ram Anup Singh accused, his wife Sheoji Devi, his daughter Sita Devi and his son-in-law Shambhu Sharan Dubey. Since Madan Singh had only one daughter namely, Sita Devi, the appellants virtually annihilated the entire family of Madan Singh who resided in village Dilman Chapra with his wife, his daughter and his son-in-law. It is the case of the prosecution that the daughter of Madan Singh and his son-in-law lived with him and looked after Madan Singh and his wife and also cultivated the lands.

2. The appellants were put up for trial before the 4th Additional District and Sessions Judge, East Champaran, Motihari who by judgment and order dated 3/9.3.2002 in Sessions Trial No. 319/33 of 1997 found the appellant Ram Anup Singh guilty of the offence under Section 302/34, 302/109 IPC and Section 27 of the Arms Act and sentenced him to death under Section 302/34 IPC and 302/109 IPC. Appellants Babban Singh and Lallan Singh were found guilty of the offence under Section 302 IPC and Section 27 Arms Act. They were also sentenced to death under Section 302 of IPC. The Trial Court passed no separate sentence under Section 27 of the Arms Act.

3. Aggrieved by the judgment and order of the Trial Court the appellants preferred Criminal Appeal No. 126 of 2000 before the High Court of Judicature at Patna. The learned Additional Sessions Judge also made a reference to the High Court for confirmation of the sentence of death passed against the appellants which was registered as Death Reference No. 4 of 2000.

4. The High Court after a detailed and critical scrutiny of the evidence on record affirmed the conviction of the appellants. On the question of sentence the High Court affirmed the sentence of death passed against the appellants Babban Singh and Lallan Singh, but refused to confirm the sentence of death passed against Ram Anup Singh, and instead, sentenced him to life imprisonment under the aforesaid sections. The High Court in doing so noticed that though Ram Anup Singh carried a licensed gun with him, and though he exhorted his sons to finish the entire family, he did not use his gun in the course of the incident and therefore did not cause any injury to anyone.

5. The appellants have preferred this appeal challenging the judgment and order of the High Court. As noticed earlier the occurrence took place on 27.3.1997 at about 6.30 a.m. in village Dilman Chapra. The investigating officer, PW-12 of Kesaria Police Station has deposed that on that day he heard a rumor that some persons have been killed in village Dilman Chapra in connection with land dispute. He therefore made station diary Entry No. 452, Ext.7 and immediately proceeded to the place of occurrence. He recorded the statement of PW-10 Babu Nand Dubey, Samdhi of Madan Singh (deceased) and father of Shambhu Sharan Dubey, the son-in-law of Madan Singh (deceased). The report was recorded at about 8.15 a.m. on the basis of which a formal F.I.R., Ext.11 was registered.

6. In his report to the police PW-10, stated that his son Shambhu Sharan Dubey was married to Sita Devi, daughter of Madan Singh about 15 years ago. Since Madan Singh had no other issue and his daughter and son-in-law were looking after him, he and his wife gifted their share of lands measuring about 9 Bighas to their daughter and son-in-law. This gave a rise to strained relationship between Madan Singh (deceased) and his brother appellant, Ram Anup Singh. According to the informant in connection with such land dispute a Panchayati was to be held on the date of occurrence and for that purpose he along with his son PW-8 Rabindra Dubey, Bhagya Narain Dubey (not examined), PW-9 Shivji Dubey his brother, PW-2 Dwarika Singh, PW-1 Mahendra Singh and PW-3 Nawal Kishore Dubey had come to village Dilman Chapra at about 6 a.m.. At about 6.30 a.m. when they were near the kirana shop of Bhageshwar Raut, Babban Singh and Lallan Singh armed with country made pistols and Ram Anup Singh armed with his licensed gun came near the kirana shop. Ram Anup Singh fired his gun in the air as a result of with persons nearby got scared and concealed themselves here and there. In the meantime his son Shambhu Sharan Dubey came on hearing the report of gun shot. On seeing him, the accused caught him and started assaulting him. Ram Anup Singh exhorted his sons to kill him as also the other members of the family. Upon this Babban Singh felled Shambhu Sharan Dubey on the ground and fired at his chest causing an injury as a result of which Shambhu Sharan Dubey died instantaneously. The accused then proceeded towards the house of Madan Singh. Sita Devi, the daughter-in-law of informant came out of the house. Lallan Singh caught hold of her and fired at her head as a result of which she also died on the spot. Thereafter Madan Singh and his wife Sheoji Devi came out of their house. Babban Singh fired at Madan Singh who fell down are died. Similarly Lallan Singh fired at Sheoji Devi causing an injury on her head as a result of which she also died instantaneously. Many persons witnessed the occurrence.

7. On the basis of the FIR lodged by PW-10, Babu Nand Dubey investigation was taken up and ultimately the three appellants were put up for trial charged variously of offences under Section 302, 302/34 and 302/109 IPC and Section 27 of the Arms Act. The prosecution examined as many as 12 witnesses to prove its case. PWs 1, 2, 3, 8, 9 and 10 are the eye witnesses. PWs 4, 5, 6, and 7 are the medical officers who performed the post mortem examination on the dead bodies of the deceased. PW-11 is a formal witness who proved the deed of gift, Ext.1/1 dated 16.10.1987, PW-12 is the investigating officer. We may notice at this stage that all the eye witnesses belong to village Jamunia Jasauli, the village of the informant. The evidence on record also discloses that village Jamunia Jasauli is at a distance of only about half a kilometer from the village of occurrence namely, Dilman Chapra. Though it is the case of the prosecution that a large number of villagers of village Dilman Chapra had witnessed the occurrence, there is also evidence on record to the effect that none of them was willing to depose against the appellants in the case.

8. PW-10, the informant has fully supported the prosecution case. The FIR was lodged by him. In his deposition before the Trial Court, he stated that Madan Singh had no son and Sita Devi was his only daughter. Madan Singh and his wife Sheoji Devi (both deceased) gifted their entire lands to their daughter and son-in-law through two deeds of gift. Shambhu Sharan Dubey used to look after Madan Singh his wife and also cultivated the lands. Ram Anup Singh, the brother of Madan Singh lived separately from his brother even from before the marriage of his daughter. They were unhappy on account of the fact that Madan Singh had executed gift deeds in favour of his daughter and son-in-law and they were persuading Madan Singh, deceased to get the deeds of gift cancelled and remove their daughter and son-in-law from the village. Panchayatis were held earlier also in respect of the gifted lands but Ram Anup Singh did not obey the decision of the Panchayat. A Panchayati was to be held on 7th March, 1997 regarding the same dispute. Ram Anup Singh and Madan Singh jointly fixed another date for Panchayati which was to be held in the morning of 27th March, 1997. It was in this connection that he and the eye witnesses had come from village Jamunia Jasauli to village Dilman Chapra. He further stated that on reaching village Dilman Chapra he had sent his son Rabindra Dubey, PW-8 to Madan Singh and Ram Anup Singh to inform them that they had arrived in the village for the Panchayati. Accordingly Rabindra Dubey went to inform them. He returned after some time and told his father that Madan Singh, deceased had told him that he was coming along with the panchas, but Ram Anup Singh was very angry and abused him. After Rabindra Dubey had returned, they heard the sound of gun shots coming from the side of darwaza of Ram Anup Singh. They got alarmed on hearing the sound of gun shots. Thereafter they saw the appellants coming to the chowk (crossing), Ram Anup Singh armed with his double barrel gun and Babban Singh and Lallan Singh armed with country made pistols. After coming to the crossing again Ram Anup Singh fired in the air. Soon thereafter Shambhu Sharan Dubey came to the crossing. He was caught hold of by Babban Singh and Lallan Singh who started assaulting him. Ram Anup singh then exhorted his sons to kill him and eliminate the entire family. Thereupon Babban Singh shot at Shambhu Sharan Dubey with his country made pistol which hit him on the left side of his chest. Shambhu Sharan Dubey fell down and died. The witness then narrated about the manner in which the other three persons were killed. The version given by him in court is consistent with the version disclosed in the FIR.

9. It is the deposition of PW-10 that Shambhu Saran Dubey married a second time with the daughter of Chabila Singh. Since Shambhu Sharan Dubey and Sita Devi had no issue, Sita Devi persuaded Shambhu Sharan Dubey to marry again and it was with her consent that Shambhu Sharan Dubey remarried. The relationship between the first and second wives of Shambhu Sharan Dubey was cordial. In fact the second wife of Shambhu Sharan Dubey also died on 11.4.1997, since on account of grief she stopped taking food and water and virtually starved herself to death. PW-10 further stated that at about 8 or 8.15 a.m. the Sub Inspector of Police came to the village and recorded his statement at the darwaza of Madan Singh. He put his signature on the statement marked Ext. 5. He mentioned about 2 deeds of gift executed by Madan Singh and his wife in favour of Shambhu Sharan Dubey and Sita Devi. The deed of gift relating to 9 Bighas of land was executed on 16.10.1987 which was marked as Ex.1/1. The second deed of gift at it appears from the evidence of PW-1 is dated 7.10.1983 marked as Ext.1, which related to about 1 Bigha and 12 Kathas of land.

10. In cross examination this witness stated that he and the witnesses were 10 to 15 steps behind the accused persons when the occurrence took place. Madan Singh had become a Sadhu and his wife also led a saintly life. He had been suggesting to his samdhi since 1983 that the dispute should be resolved by Panchayati. He had also talked to the villagers as well as to the accused persons in this connection. Several Panchayatis were held since 1983. This witness admitted that his samdhi Madan Singh, his wife Sheoji Devi and their daughter Sita Devi had filed Title Suit against his son Shambhu Sharan Dubey. This case was got filed by the appellants by misleading Madan Singh. The suit ended in favour of his son Shambhu Sharan Dubey against which the plaintiffs filed an appeal but the same was compromised. All this was done at the instance of the accused persons whom is guided his samdhi, but ultimately the matter ended in a compromise. Even after the compromise was recorded in T.A. No. 93/92, the dispute between Madan Singh and the accused persons subsisted. The accused persons used to cut the trees belonging to his samdhi, and such other small disputes arose from time to time about which complaints were made to the Mukhiya of the village.

11. The witness met his samdhi Madan Singh a day before the occurrence. he had also met him on the 24th March when he had requested him to come for the Panchayati to be held on 27th March. After the occurrence large number of persons, about 2000 in number, had collected near the place of occurrence. The crowd had collected one hour after the occurrence and he named the persons whom he recognized in the crowd. This witness has stated that when he saw that his son Shambhu Sharan Dubey was being assaulted he wanted to go to his rescue, but Nawal Kishore Dubey, PW-3 caught hold of him. Similarly Shivji Dubey, PW-9 caught hold of his son Rabindra Dubey no wanted to intervene. The firing took place from a short distance of about 2 to 2-1/2 feet. The entire occurrence took place within 15 minutes i.e. between 6.30 & 6.45 a.m.. Police Station Kesaria is situated at a distance of about 12-13 kilometers from the place of occurrence.

12. We have very carefully scrutinized the evidence of PW-10, who is not only the informant, but also an eye witness. We find nothing in his rather lengthy cross examination which may impeach his credibility. He has deposed in a straightforward manner and we find a ring of truth in what he says. Moreover, his evidence is fully corroborated by the medical evidence on record, and the testimony of eye witnesses.

13. PW-1, Mahendra Singh is also an eye witness. He had come to village Dilman Chapra where he met the informant and others near the kirana shop of Bhageshwar Raut. He has deposed about the prevailing strained relationship between Ram Anup Singh and Madan Singh (deceased) owing to the execution of deeds of gift by Madan Singh in favour of his daughter and son-in-law. Ram Anup Singh wanted that the deeds of gift be cancelled. This witness had also come in connection with the Panchayati to be held in the morning at 6.30 a.m. He has deposed about the occurrence in substantially the same manner as the informant PW-10. This witness stated that the earlier deed of gift was executed by Madan Singh and his wife on 7.10.1983 in respect of land measuring about 1 Bigha 12 Kathas. He was a witness to the said deed of gift. That deed of gift was marked as Ext. 1. This witness also stated that the distance between villages Dilman Chapra and Jamunia Jasauli is about half a kilometer. He admitted that there was no written intimation about the convening of Panchayati but he was informed verbally about it on 24th March, 1997 at 10 O'clock in the morning. Information was sent to him by Madan Singh (deceased) with a request that he should attend the Panchayati. The Sub Inspector of Police had reached the place of occurrence at about 8 a.m. and the Superintendent of Police and Dy. Superintendent of Police also arrived at about 12 noon. He had seen the Sub-Inspector of Police recording the statement of witnesses. His statement was recorded by the Dy. Superintendent of Police at about 12 noon. A large number of villagers of Dilman Chapra and other villages had collected numbering about 1000. Though they were present none of the villagers of Dilman Chapra made a statement before the police. He did not hear anyone saying that any dacoity had been committed in the house of Madan Singh. Counsel for the appellant could not point out anything in the cross-examination of this witness which may render his deposition unreliable or untrustworthy, except for submitting that his testimony is too consistent to be believed.

14. PW-2, Dwarika Singh is another eye witness who had accompanied the informant to village Dilman Chapra in connection with the Panchayati to be held on that day. His evidence fully corroborates the testimony of PW-10 (informant) and this led counsel for the appellants to submit that the consistency in the evidence of the witnesses must persuade this Court to hold that they are got up witnesses. Nothing however was shown to us in the cross-examination of this witness which may reflect upon his veracity.

15. PW-3 Nawal Kishore Dubey also deposed as an eye witness. He has fully supported the prosecution case and deposed about the manner of occurrence on the same lines as the informant and the other eye witnesses. He has stated that his statement was recorded by the Police on that very day and that he was present when the Police arrived at the scene of occurrence. He has deposed about the manner in which the investigation was conducted and proved the signatures of witnesses appearing on the seizure lists, Exts.2 and 3. Nothing has been pointed out by the counsel for the appellants which may lead us to discard his testimony.

16. Remaining two eye witnesses PWs. 8 and 9 are the son and brother respectively on the informant PW-10. Both of them have been cross-examined at length but nothing of significance has been elicited from them. PW-8, Rabindra Dubey is the son of the informant and the younger brother of deceased Shambhu Sharan Dubey. He has deposed about the marriage of his brother with Sita Devi and about the execution of gift deeds in their favour which gave rise to unpleasantness between Madan Singh (deceased) and Ram Anup Singh. He has asserted that he reached the chowk of village Dilman Chapra at about 6 a.m. His father asked him to go and inform Madan Singh and Ram Anup Singh that persons had arrived at the chowk for Panchayati. He first went to Madan Singh where he met his brother Shambhu Sharan Singh. He was told that they will be coming soon. Thereafter he went to the darwaza of Ram Anup singh whom he saw sitting with a gun. As soon as he saw him he became furious and started abusing him. He then returned to the chowk and reported to his father. He has narrated the manner in which he occurrence took place. We have found nothing in the cross examination of this witness which may lead us to suspect his testimony. His presence appears to be quite natural since a Panchayati was to be held concerning the lands which were gifted to his brother. It was therefore natural for him to accompany his father to attend the Panchayati. This witness was present when the Sub-Inspector of Police came and later the Superintendent of Police and the Dy. Superintendent of Police arrived. He also stated that large number of persons had assembled after the occurrence belonging to different villages. The Sub-Inspector of Police recorded the statement of witnesses including his statement. By 5 p.m. recording of statements was completed. He denied the suggestion that a crowd had assembled since a dacoity was committed in the house of Madan Singh in the night. In fact that was no talk of dacoity.

17. Similar is the evidence of PW-9 Shivji Dubey, who is the brother of the informant. This witness has also narrated the occurrence in the same manner as the other eye witnesses. He also mentioned the presence of other eye witnesses named in the FIR.

18. We find that as many as six eye witnesses have been examined by the prosecution. Nothing has been elicited in their cross-examination which may lead us to doubt their reliability or truthfulness. The only criticism leveled against them is that three of them are relatives of the informant and all the six belong to village Jamunia Jasauli. It was faintly suggested that their evidence is too consistent to be true. It is no doubt true that PWs. 8, 9 and 10 are related. PW-9 and 10 are brothers and PW-8 is the son of PW-10, the informant. However, having regard to the facts of this case their evidence cannot be discarded merely on the ground that they are related to each other. There is abundant evidence on record to establish that on 27th March 1997 a Panchayati was to be held concerning the disputes between Madan Singh, (deceased) and Ram Anup Singh accused. The dispute related to the lands gifted by Madan Singh to his daughter and son-in-law. PW-10, the informant being the father of Shambhu Sharan Dubey, son-in-law of Madan Singh, was naturally interested in attending the Panchayati. In fact Madan Singh had requested him to attend the Panchayati. His brother and son had accompanied him to village Dilman Chapra. Having regard to these facts, their evidence cannot be thrown out merely on the ground that they are related and interested witnesses. The eye witness account given by these witnesses is natural as well as consistent. Their presence at the scene of occurrence cannot be doubted in view of the overwhelming evidence on record. They are not only named in the FIR but their presence is confirmed by the other eye witnesses.

19. It was then urged that all the six eye witnesses belong to village Jamunia Jasauli and no witness from village Dilman Chapra has been examined. Apart from the eye witnesses, even the investigating officer, PW-12 has deposed that persons belonging to village Dilman Chapra were not willing to make a statement before him, and therefore no witness of village Dilman Chapra could be examined as an eye witness. It is obvious that the occurrence must have been witnessed by a large number of persons belonging to village Dilman Chapra since it took place between 6.30 and 6.45 a.m. in the heart of the village. However, on account of village relationship their reluctance to depose against the appellants can be well appreciated. The co-villagers perhaps, did not want to get themselves involved in this affair. The eye witnesses no doubt belong to village Jamunia Jasauli but one cannot ignore the fact that Jamunia Jasauli is at a distant of only half a kilometer from village Dilman Chapra. On the request of Madan Singh (deceased) and on the persuasion of the informant these witnesses had come to take part in the Panchayati to be held that morning. They cannot therefore be described as mere chance witnesses. They had come to that village with a purpose and were not mere passers by. We have found their deposition to be convincing and truthful.

20. The consistency in the evidence of the eye witnesses is also understandable in the facts of this case. The witnesses were known to each other and they also knew the appellants and their victims. The occurrence took place in the morning and there was sufficient light to enable the witnesses to identify the appellants and the deceased. The assault on the victims was not simultaneous. They were shot dead one after the other. The witnesses were only 10 to 15 steps behind the assailants, and had therefore the opportunity to notice the manner in which the occurrence took place and the role played by the appellants. There was therefore no scope for any confusion in the mind of the witnesses. Their statements were recorded immediately after the arrival of the Investigating Officer. In these circumstances the case of the prosecution cannot be disbelieved merely because the testimony of the eye witnesses is consistent by raising a suspicion that they may be got up or tutored witnesses.

21. Another feature of the case is that the occurrence took place between 6.30 and 6.45 a.m. Soon thereafter the Sub-Inspector of Police, PW-12 reached the village on hearing a rumor after making an entry in the Station Diary. Though the Police Station is about 13 kilometers away from the village of occurrence, he showed great promptness in reaching the village of occurrence at about 8- 8.15 a.m. He recorded the statement of the informant, PW-10 and commenced investigation. There was hardly any delay in lodging the FIR, and therefore, there was no opportunity for the informant to concoct a false story. All the eye witnesses are named in the FIR and their presence is confirmed by the fact that their statements were also recorded immediately by the investigating officer. Moreover, by noon even the Superintendent of Police and the Dy. Superintendent of Police had reached the village of occurrence to supervise the investigation. The postmortem examination of dead bodies was also held on the same day by 4 different medical officers. This is a rare case where we have found that the investigating agency acted with great promptitude. We, therefore, do not suspect that the prosecution concocted a false case.

22. The Trial Court as well as the High Court have carefully scrutinised the evidence on record. The medical evidence on record fully supports the prosecution case, and it has been so found by the High Court as well as by the Trial Court. We have also gone through the deposition of the medical officers. We are satisfied that the injuries suffered by the deceased resulting in their death as found by the medical officers, corroborate the manner of occurrence as deposed to by the eye witnesses. Counsel for the appellants submitted that the firing was obviously from close range, but this fact is also established by the medical evidence on record. In fact some of the injuries bore charring marks. We are, therefore, satisfied that the medical evidence fully corroborates the case of the prosecution.

23. The defence set up by the appellants was that a dacoity was committed in the house of Madan Singh on the night intervening 26th and 27th March, 1997. In the course of the dacoity all the members of the family were shot dead by the dacoits. The appellants also examined three witnesses to substantiate their defence. The Trial Court as well as the High Court have carefully examined the evidence of the witnesses examined by the defence but came to the conclusion that the defence set up by the appellants was not supported by any reliable evidence on record. We have carefully gone through the deposition of the defence witnesses and we find that the conclusion reached by the courts below is fully justified. DW-1 stated that a dacoity was committed in the house of deceased Madan Singh in which he and his family members were killed. Many people had assembled when the dacoity was committed but no information was given to the policy by anyone. He, no doubt, stated that Jagarnath Rai, the Chowkidar has informed the police. The said Chowkidar has not been examined. Similar assertion was made by DW-2 who belongs to village Jamunia Jasauli and claimed to be present in village Dilman Chapra when the dacoity took place. He claimed to have constructed a Baithka in village Dilman Chapra, but he could produce no document to show that he owned any land in Dilman Chapra or that he had constructed a Baithka. He also stated that no case of dacoity was registered. So far as DW-3 is concerned he claims to have heard that dacoity was committed in the house of Madan Singh. Obviously no value can be attached to his statement.

24. What is conspicuous in the evidence of the defence witnesses is that fact that though a dacoity is alleged to have been committed, and as many as four persons lost their lives, no one informed the police about the occurrence, even though large number of villagers had assembled when the dacoity took place. Apart from the other villagers, one would have expected the appellant Ram Anup Singh, the brother of Madan Singh, to have informed the police about the occurrence in which four members of his brother's family were shot dead. In any event he would have made an attempt to send information to the Police Station. It does not appear that any such attempt was made by Ram Anup Singh. Moreover, the case that a dacoity had been committed in the house of Madan Singh was sought to be built up for the first time at the stage of the trial. The eye witnesses to whom such suggestion was made categorically denied having heard anyone talk about commission of dacoity on the date of occurrence. The Investigating Officer has also categorically stated that there was no talk about commission of dacoity when he was in the village conducting the investigation. There was not even a whisper about a dacoity having been committed. No report was made to him about the commission of dacoity. One fails to understand why when the Investigating Officer came to the village of occurrence no one reported about the commission of dacoity, even if for any reason it was not done earlier. Moreover, there is evidence on record that no article was removed from the house of Madan Singh. We have, therefore, no hesitation in rejecting the defence case as fake, and an after though. There is no convincing evidence on record which may even probablise the case of dacoity having been committed in the house of Madan Singh on the night preceding the day of occurrence.

25. Having carefully considered the evidence on record we are satisfied that the conviction of the appellants is fully justified in the facts and circumstances of the case.

26. On the question of sentence, it was submitted on behalf of the appellants that this was not appropriate case in which the extreme penalty of death was warranted, since this case does not fall in the category of the rarest of rare cases. It is true that as many as four innocent lives were lost and the act of the appellants was certainly an inhuman cruel and dastardly act. However, one aspect of the matter deserves to be mentioned while on the question of sentence. It is not disputed that the gift deed was executed sometime in the year 1987 which gave rise to strained relationship between Madan Singh on the one hand and Ram Anup Singh and his sons on the other. There is evidence on record to suggest that several Panchayatis were held to resolve the dispute. The case of the prosecution is that Ram Anup Singh even resorted to litigation and instigated Madan Singh to file a Civil Suit against his son-in-law for cancellation of the deed of gift. That matter was however compromised and it appears that thereafter cordial relationship prevailed in the family of Madan Singh, Minor disputes arose between Madan Singh and Ram Anup Singh from time to time. However, while all these events took place over ten years, there is not even a suggestion that the appellants ever resorted to violence or that any untoward incident took place in the past. The appellants were no doubt aggrieved but they did not take the law into their hands though they tried all other non violent methods available to them, including litigation and Panchayati. In the background of such facts one fails to understand why on the date of occurrence suddenly the appellants decided to do away with all the members of the family. The High Court has also considered this aspect of the matter and found that there was nothing to suggest that the crime perpetuated by the appellants was by way of retaliation. The High Court is right in making this observation because there is nothing on record to suggest that any untoward incident had taken place on the earlier day or a few days before the occurrence which may have aggravated the situation and motivated the appellants to resort to the drastic action of killing all the members of the family of Madan Singh. We have a lurking suspicion that something must have happened on account of which the appellants resorted to the mass killing. The evidence on record does not provide any clue. It may be that the persons who could have thrown some light on this aspect of the matter are not alive to depose, and the appellants not willing to say anything on this aspect of the matter lest it may prejudice their defence. We, therefore, do not have any knowledge about the immediate cause for the occurrence. In this background the question of sentence may be considered.

27. There is no evidence on record to suggest that the appellants are a menace to society as evident by their past deeds. It is not possible to conclude that they are those who cannot be reformed or rehabilitated and that they constitute a continuing threat to the society. In fact, apart form the incident in question, there is not even an allegation about the appellants having indulged in such behavior in the past or having resorted to violence and committed any offence whatsoever. They appear to belong to a middle class farmer family for whom land has great value. But even so, there is nothing to suggest that they may repeat such barbarism in future so that they would constitute a continuing threat to the society. Having regard to all the facts and circumstances, and also having regard to the fact that the evidence does not disclose the immediate cause of the incident, we do not find it safe to confirm the sentence of death awarded by the High Court to Lallan Singh and Babban Singh. In Prakash Dhawal Khairnar (Patil) v. State of Maharashtra MANU/SC/0788/2001MANU/SC/0788/2001 : 2002CriLJ928 the accused gunned down his own brother and his family members and also his mother. The disputes arose on account of the fact that his brother was not willing to partition the joint family properties. This Court held that though it was a heinous and brutal crime, yet it did not fall in the category of the rarest of rare cases. There was no evidence to support that the appellant in that case was a menace to society. There was also no reason to believe that he could not be reformed or rehabilitate, and he was likely to continue his criminal acts of violence as would constitute continuing threat to the society. The facts are som"

1. Leave granted.

2. The appeal arises out of the order dated 21.1.2011 passed by the High Court of Chhatisgarh at Bilaspur, thereby affirming the order dated 29.6.2002 passed by the Sessions Judge and Judicial Magistrate First Class, Dharamjaigarh, rejecting the application filed by the accused Appellant for discharge on the ground of requirement of sanction to prosecute Under Section 197(1) Code of Criminal Procedure.

3. As per the prosecution case, the Appellant was in-charge of Patthalgaon Hospital, District Raigad where on 1.1.1995 L.T.D. operation of Runiabai was conducted by Dr. A.M. Gupta. Thereafter she was sent home. As Runiabai vomited Dr. A.M. Gupta was approached. He sent one Aklu Ram to administer some treatment. However on 2.2.1995 she was brought to the Primary Health Centre, Patthalgaon where she was admitted and died at 2 p.m. Her post mortem was conducted. After 25 days, First Information Report was lodged and ultimately Police filed chargesheet Under Section 304A Indian Penal Code on 16.10.1996 in the court of Judicial Magistrate First Class, Dharamjaigarh, as against Appellant A.K. Jha, Dr. A.M. Gupta and Aklu Ram. Charges Under Section 304A were framed as against Dr. A.M. Gupta and the Appellant. Both of them filed an application for discharge Under Section 197 Code of Criminal Procedure on the ground that sanction to prosecute was required and they could not be prosecuted without previous sanction. Vide order dated 27.6.2001 passed by the Judicial Magistrate First Class, the application filed by Dr. A.M. Garg had been allowed. However, the application filed by the Appellant was rejected on the ground that he was in-charge of the Primary Health Centre and he failed to provide Government jeep for shifting the patient Mrs. Runiabai to District Hospital, Raigad whereas the Appellant himself travelled in the jeep to attend an official monthly meeting at Raigad which was District Headquarters. The Primary Health Centre did not have ambulance. Thus, negligence was attributed to the Appellant for not providing the said vehicle for shifting the patient to District Hospital, Raigad. A revision was preferred against the rejection of prayer and thereafter a petition was filed Under Section 482 Code of Criminal Procedure before the High Court, the same having been dismissed, the Appellant is before us.

4. It was vehemently contended by learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant that the allegations constituted failure to provide official vehicle for shifting the patient to District Hospital, Raigad. As it was an act in discharge of official duty, as such the sanction to prosecute was necessary. Whereas the application filed by Dr. A.M. Gupta had been allowed, the prayer made by the Appellant has been illegally rejected. Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the State supported the order and contended that it was negligence on behalf of the Appellant in not providing official vehicle to the patient due to which she could not be shifted to District Hospital, Raigad and died. Thus, sanction was not required in the instant case.

5. It is apparent from the facts of the instant case that the allegation against the Appellant is of omission in discharge of official duty in not providing Government vehicle for shifting the patient from Primary Health Centre to District Hospital, Raigad; whereas he himself travelled in the vehicle in question for attending the monthly official meeting at the District Headquarters. In our considered opinion, it was an act or omission in discharge of the official duty. The sanction to prosecute was necessary. In this case, the accused was acting in discharge of his official duty when he refused to provide the official vehicle. The refusal is directly and reasonably connected with his official duty, thus sanction is required for prosecution as provided Under Section 197(1) Code of Criminal Procedure. It is not disputed that no ambulance was provided to the Primary Health Centre. The question arises whether omission to provide the official jeep which was not meant for patients, would constitute an omission in discharge of his duty. Though public servant is not entitled to indulge in criminal activities in the course of his duty but the act in question had relation to discharge of official duty of the accused. It was clearly connected to the performance of his official duty. When such is the case, sanction is required. This Court in Shreekantiah Ramayya Munipalli v. The State of Bombay MANU/SC/0050/1954MANU/SC/0050/1954 : 1955 (1) SCR 1177 has observed thus:

Now it is obvious that if Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is construed too narrowly it can never be applied, for of course it is no part of an official's duty to commit an offence and never can be. But it is not the duty we have to examine so much as the act, because an official act can be performed in the discharge of official duty as well as in dereliction of it. The Section has content and its language must be given meaning. What it says is -

when any public servant ..... is accused of any offence alleged to have been committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty......

We have therefore first to concentrate on the word 'offence'.

Now an offence seldom consists of a single act. It is usually composed of several elements and, as a rule, a whole series of acts must be proved before it can be established. In the present case, the elements alleged against the second accused are, first, that there was an ""entrustment"" and/or ""dominion""; second, that the entrustment and/or dominion was ""in his capacity as a public servant""; third, that there was a ""disposal""; and fourth, that the disposal was ""dishonest"". Now it is evident that the entrustment and/or dominion here were in an official capacity, and it is equally evident that there could in this case be no disposal, lawful or otherwise, save by an act done or purporting to be done in an official capacity. Therefore, the act complained of, namely the disposal, could not have been done in any other way. If it was innocent, it was an official act; if dishonest, it was the dishonest doing of an official act, but in either event the act was official because the second accused could not dispose of the goods save by the doing of an official act, namely officially permitting their disposal; and that he did. He actually permitted their release and purported to do it in an official capacity, and apart from the fact that he did not pretend to act privately, there was no other way in which he could have done it. Therefore, whatever the intention or motive behind the act may have been, the physical part of it remained unaltered, so if it was official in the one case it was equally official in the other, and the only difference would lie in the intention with which it was done: in the one event, it would be done in the discharge of an official duty and in the other, in the purported discharge of it.

The act of abetment alleged against him stands on the same footing, for his part in the abetment was to permit the disposal of the goods by the doing of an official act and thus ""willfully suffer"" another person to use them dishonestly: Section 405 of the Indian Penal Code. In both cases, the ""offence"" in his case would be incomplete without proving the official act.

We therefore hold that Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure applies and that sanction was necessary, and as there was none the trial is vitiated from the start. We therefore quash the proceedings against the second accused as also his conviction and sentence.

6. This Court in Matajog Dobey v. H.C. Bhari MANU/SC/0071/1955MANU/SC/0071/1955 : 1955 (2) SCR 925 has also considered when sanction is necessary. This Court has laid down thus:

Is the need for sanction to be considered as soon as the complaint is lodged and on the allegations therein contained? At first sight, it seems as though there is some support for this view in Hori Ram's case and also in Sarjoo Prasad v. The King-Emperor MANU/FE/0007/1945MANU/FE/0007/1945 : (1945) F.C.R. 227. Sulaiman, J. says that as the prohibition is against the institution itself, its applicability must be judged in the first instance at the earliest stage of institution. Varadachariar, J. also states that the question must be determined with reference to the nature of the allegations made against the public servant in the criminal proceeding. But a careful perusal of the later parts of their judgments shows that they did not intent to lay down any such proposition. Sulaiman, J. refers (at page 179) to the prosecution case as disclosed by the complaint or the police report and he winds up the discussion in these words: ""Of course, if the case as put forward fails or the defence establishes that the act purported to be done is in execution of duty, the proceedings will have to be dropped and the complaint dismissed on that ground"". The other learned Judge also states at page 185, ""At this stage we have only to see whether the case alleged against the Appellant or sought to be proved against him relates to acts done or purporting to be done by him in the execution of his duty"". It must be so. The question may arise at any stage of the proceedings. The complaint may not disclose that the act constituting the offence was done or purported to be done in the discharge of official duty; but facts subsequently coming to light on a police or judicial inquiry or even in the course of the prosecution evidence at the trial, may establish the necessity for sanction. Whether sanction is necessary or not may have to be determined from stage to stage. The necessity may reveal itself in the course of the progress of the case.

7. In Bhappa Singh v. Ram Pal Singh and Ors. 1981 (Supp) SCC 12 this Court considered the grant of protection to an officer for official act done in good faith thus:

6. In view of the circumstances mentioned in the last paragraph, there is little room for doubt that the Customs party was not out to commit dacoity either in the jewellery shop or the chaubara, that they also committed no trespass into either of those places, but that the purpose of the raid was to find out if any illegal activity was being carried on therein. The presence of two licensed Gold-smiths in the chaubara speaks volumes in that behalf. It may further be taken for granted that the Customs party was manhandled before they themselves resorted to violence, because there was no reason for them to open fire unless they were resisted in the carrying out of the raid peacefully.

7. Even though what we have just stated is a general prima facie impression that we have formed at this stage on the materials available to us at present, it may not be possible to come to a conclusive finding about the falsity or otherwise of the complaint. But then we think that it would amount to giving a go-by to Section 108 of the Gold (Control) Act, if cases of this type are allowed to be pursued to their logical conclusion, i.e., to that of conviction or acquittal. In this view of the matter we do not feel inclined to upset the impugned order, even though perhaps the matter may have required further evidence before quashing of the complaint could be held to be fully justified. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

8. In State of Maharashtra v. Dr. Budhikota Subbarao MANU/SC/0516/1993MANU/SC/0516/1993 : 1993 (3) SCC 339, this Court has considered the meaning of the 'official act' thus:

6. Such being the nature of the provision the question is how should the expression, 'any offence alleged to have been committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty', be understood? What does it mean? 'Official' according to dictionary, means pertaining to an office. And official act or official duty means an act or duty done by an officer in his official capacity. In S.B. Saha v. M.S. Kochar MANU/SC/0075/1979MANU/SC/0075/1979 : (1979) 4 SCC 177 it was held: (SCC pp. 184-85, para 17)

The words 'any offence alleged to have been committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty' employed in Section 197(1) of the Code, are capable of a narrow as well as a wide interpretation. If these words are construed too narrowly, the Section will be rendered altogether sterile, for, 'it is no part of an official duty to commit an offence, and never can be'. In the wider sense, these words will take under their umbrella every act constituting an offence, committed in the course of the same transaction in which the official duty is performed or purports to be performed. The right approach to the import of these words lies between these two extremes. While on the one hand, it is not every offence committed by a public servant while engaged in the performance of his official duty, which is entitled to the protection of Section 197(1), an act constituting an offence, directly and reasonably connected with his official duty will require sanction for prosecution under the said provision.

Use of the expression, 'official duty' implies that the act or omission must have been done by the public servant in course of his service and that it should have been in discharge of his duty. The Section does not extend its protective cover to every act or omission done by a public servant in service but restricts its scope of operation to only those acts or omissions which are done by a public servant in discharge of official duty. In P. Arulswami v. State of Madras MANU/SC/0092/1966MANU/SC/0092/1966 : (1967) 1 SCR 201 this Court after reviewing the authorities right from the days of Federal Court and Privy Council held:

...It is not therefore every offence committed by a public servant that requires sanction for prosecution Under Section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure; nor even every act done by him while he is actually engaged in the performance of his official duties; but if the act complained of is directly concerned with his official duties so that, if questioned, it could be claimed to have been done by virtue of the office, then sanction would be necessary. It is the quality of the act that is important and if it falls within the scope and range of his official duties the protection contemplated by Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure will be attracted. An offence may be entirely unconnected with the official duty as such or it may be committed within the scope of the official duty. Where it is unconnected with the official duty there can be no protection. It is only when it is either within the scope of the official duty or in excess of it that the protection is claimable.

It has been widened further by extending protection to even those acts or omissions which are done in purported exercise of official duty. That is under the colour of office. Official duty therefore implies that the act or omission must have been done by the public servant in course of his service and such act or omission must have been performed as part of duty which further must have been official in nature. The Section has, thus, to be construed strictly, while determining its applicability to any act or omission in course of service. Its operation has to be limited to those duties which are discharged in course of duty. But once any act or omission has been found to have been committed by a public servant in discharge of his duty then it must be given liberal and wide construction so far its official nature is concerned. For instance a public servant is not entitled to indulge in criminal activities. To that extent the Section has to be construed narrowly and in a restricted manner. But once it is established that act or omission was done by the public servant while discharging his duty then the scope of its being official should be construed so as to advance the objective of the Section in favour of the public servant. Otherwise the entire purpose of affording protection to a public servant without sanction shall stand frustrated. For instance a police officer in discharge of duty may have to use force which may be an offence for the prosecution of which the sanction may be necessary. But if the same officer commits an act in course of service but not in discharge of his duty then the bar Under Section 197 of the Code is not attracted. To what extent an act or omission performed by a public servant in discharge of his duty can be deemed to be official was explained by this Court in Matajog Dubey v. H.C. Bhari MANU/SC/0071/1955MANU/SC/0071/1955 : AIR 1956 SC 44 thus:

[T]he offence alleged to have been committed (by the accused) must have something to do, or must be related in some manner with the discharge of official duty ... there must be a reasonable connection between the act and the discharge of official duty; the act must bear such relation to the duty that the accused could lay a reasonable (claim) but not a pretended or fanciful claim, that he did it in the course of the performance of his duty.

(Emphasis supplied)

If on facts, therefore, it is prima facie found that the act or omission for which the accused was charged had reasonable connection with discharge of his duty then it must be held to be official to which applicability of Section 197 of the Code cannot be disputed.""

9. In State of H.P. v. M.P. Gupta MANU/SC/1003/2003MANU/SC/1003/2003 : 2004 (2) SCC 349 this Court in regard to official duty has laid down thus:

11. Such being the nature of the provision, the question is how should the expression, ""any offence alleged to have been committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty"", be understood? What does it mean? ""Official"" according to the dictionary, means pertaining to an office, and official act or official duty means an act or duty done by an officer in his official capacity.

10. In State of Orissa and Ors. v. Ganesh Chandra Jew MANU/SC/0264/2004MANU/SC/0264/2004 : 2004 (8) SCC 40 this Court has laid down that protection Under Section 197 would be available only when the act done by the public servant is reasonably connected with the discharge of his official duty. This Court has laid down thus:

7. The protection given Under Section 197 is to protect responsible public servants against the institution of possibly vexatious criminal proceedings for offences alleged to have been committed by them while they are acting or purporting to act as public servants. The policy of the legislature is to afford adequate protection to public servants to ensure that they are not prosecuted for anything done by them in the discharge of their official duties without reasonable cause, and if sanction is granted, to confer on the Government, if they choose to exercise it, complete control of the prosecution. This protection has certain limits and is available only when the alleged act done by the public servant is reasonably connected with the discharge of his official duty and is not merely a cloak for doing the objectionable act. If in doing his official duty, he acted in excess of his duty, but there is a reasonable connection between the act and the performance of the official duty, the excess will not be a sufficient ground to deprive the public servant of the protection. The question is not as to the nature of the offence such as whether the alleged offence contained an element necessarily dependent upon the offender being a public servant, but whether it was committed by a public servant acting or purporting to act as such in the discharge of his official capacity. Before Section 197 can be invoked, it must be shown that the official concerned was accused of an offence alleged to have been committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duties. It is not the duty which requires examination so much as the act, because the official act can be performed both in the discharge of the official duty as well as in dereliction of it. The act must fall within the scope and range of the official duties of the public servant concerned. It is the quality of the act which is important and the protection of this Section is available if the act falls within the scope and range of his official duty. There cannot be any universal Rule to determine whether there is a reasonable connection between the act done and the official duty, nor is it possible to lay down any such rule. One safe and sure test in this regard would be to consider if the omission or neglect on the part of the public servant to commit the act complained of could have made him answerable for a charge of dereliction of his official duty. If the answer to this question is in the affirmative, it may be said that such act was committed by the public servant while acting in the discharge of his official duty and there was every connection with the act complained of and the official duty of the public servant. This aspect makes it clear that the concept of Section 197 does not get immediately attracted on institution of the complaint case.

11. In K. Kalimuthu v. State by DSP MANU/SC/0248/2005MANU/SC/0248/2005 : 2005 (4) SCC 512 this Court has observed that official duty implies that an act or omission must have been done by the public servant within the scope and range of his official duty for protection. This Court has laid down thus:

12. If on facts, therefore, it is prima facie found that the act or omission for which the accused was charged had reasonable connection with discharge of his duty then it must be held to be official to which applicability of Section 197 of the Code cannot be disputed.

15. The question relating to the need of sanction Under Section 197 of the Code is not necessarily to be considered as soon as the complaint is lodged and on the allegations contained therein. This question may arise at any stage of the proceeding. The question whether sanction is necessary or not may have to be determined from stage to stage. Further, in cases where offences under the Act are concerned, the effect of Section 197, dealing with the question of prejudice has also to be noted.

12. In Manorama Tiwari and Ors. v. Surendra Nath Rai MANU/SC/1005/2015MANU/SC/1005/2015 : 2016(1) SCC 594, it was held that the Appellants were discharging public duties while performing surgery in a Government hospital, hence prosecution was not maintainable without sanction from the State Government.

13. In State of Madhya Pradesh v. Sheetla Sahai and Ors. MANU/SC/1425/2009MANU/SC/1425/2009 : 2009 (8) SCC 617, this Court has laid down thus:

59. For the purpose of attracting the provisions of Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it is not necessary that they must act in their official capacity but even where public servants purport to act in their official capacity, the same would attract the provisions of Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It was so held by this Court in Sankaran Moitra v. Sadhna Das MANU/SC/1484/2006MANU/SC/1484/2006 : (2006) 4 SCC 584. The question came up for consideration before this Court in Matajog Dobey v. H.C. Bhari MANU/SC/0071/1955MANU/SC/0071/1955 : AIR 1956 SC 44 wherein it was held: (AIR pp. 48-49, para 17)

17. Slightly differing tests have been laid down in the decided cases to ascertain the scope and the meaning of the relevant words occurring in Section 197 of the Code; 'any offence alleged to have been committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty'. But the difference is only in language and not in substance.

The offence alleged to have been committed must have something to do, or must be related in some manner, with the discharge of official duty. No question of sanction can arise Under Section 197, unless the act complained of is an offence; the only point to determine is whether it was committed in the discharge of official duty. There must be a reasonable connection between the act and the official duty. It does not matter even if the act exceeds what is strictly necessary for the discharge of the duty, as this question will arise only at a later stage when the trial proceeds on the merits.

What we must find out is whether the act and the official duty are so interrelated that one can postulate reasonably that it was done by the accused in the performance of the official duty, though possibly in excess of the needs and requirements of the situation. In Hori Ram Singh v. Crown MANU/FE/0001/1939MANU/FE/0001/1939 : 1939 FCR 159 Sulaiman, J. observes:

The Section cannot be confined to only such acts as are done by a public servant directly in pursuance of his public office, though in excess of the duty or under a mistaken belief as to the existence of such duty. Nor is it necessary to go to the length of saying that the act constituting the offence should be so inseparably connected with the official duty as to form part and parcel of the same transaction.

The interpretation that found favour with Varadachariar, J. in the same case is stated by him in these terms at p. 56:

There must be something in the nature of the act complained of that attaches it to the official character of the person doing it.

In affirming this view, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council observed in Gill case: MANU/PR/0013/1948MANU/PR/0013/1948 : AIR 1948 PC 128 (IA pp. 59-60)

A public servant can only be said to act or to purport to act in the discharge of his official duty, if his act is such as to lie within the scope of his official duty. ... The test may well be whether the public servant, if challenged, can reasonably claim that, what he does, he does in virtue of his office.

Hori Ram case MANU/FE/0001/1939MANU/FE/0001/1939 : 1939 FCR 159 is referred to with approval in the later case of Lieutenant Hector Thomas Huntley v. King Emperor MANU/FE/0017/1944MANU/FE/0017/1944 : 1944 FCR 262 but the test laid down that it must be established that the act complained of was an 'official' act appears to us unduly to narrow down the scope of the protection afforded by Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as defined and understood in the earlier case. The decision in Albert West Meads v. R. MANU/PR/0018/1948MANU/PR/0018/1948 : AIR 1948 PC 156 does not carry us any further; it adopts the reasoning in Gill case MANU/PR/0013/1948MANU/PR/0013/1948 : AIR 1948 PC 128.

60. The said principle has been reiterated by this Court in B. Saha v. M.S. Kochar MANU/SC/0075/1979MANU/SC/0075/1979 : (1979) 4 SCC 177 in the following terms: (SCC pp. 184-85, paras 17-18)

17. The words 'any offence alleged to have been committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty' employed in Section 197(1) of the Code, are capable of a narrow as well as a wide interpretation. If these words are construed too narrowly, the Section will be rendered altogether sterile, for, 'it is no part of an official duty to commit an offence, and never can be'. In the wider sense, these words will take under their umbrella every act constituting an offence, committed in the course of the same transaction in which the official duty is performed or purports to be performed. The right approach to the import of these words lies between these two extremes. While on the one hand, it is not every offence committed by a public servant while engaged in the performance of his official duty, which is entitled to the protection of Section 197(1), an act constituting an offence, directly and reasonably connected with his official duty will require sanction for prosecution under the said provision. As pointed out by Ramaswami, J. in Baijnath v. State of M.P. MANU/SC/0081/1965MANU/SC/0081/1965 : AIR 1966 SC 220: (AIR p. 227, para 16)

16. ...It is the quality of the act that is important, and if it falls within the scope and range of his official duties the protection contemplated by Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure will be attracted.

18. In sum, the sine qua non for the applicability of this Section is that the offence charged, be it one of commission or omission, must be one which has been committed by the public servant either in his official capacity or under colour of the office held by him.

(Emphasis in original)

14. In view of the aforesaid discussion, it is clear that the omission complained of due to which offence is stated to have been committed, was intrinsically connected with discharge of official duty of the Appellant, as such the protection Under Section 197 Code of Criminal Procedure from prosecution without sanction of the competent authority, is available to the Appellant. Thus, he could not have been prosecuted without sanction. It would be for the competent authority to consider the question of grant of sanction in accordance with law. In case sanction is granted only then the Appellant can be prosecuted and not otherwise. Resultantly, the impugned orders are set aside, the appeal is allowed.

4. These appeals are directed against the judgment(s) and order(s) passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana in a batch of Regular First Appeals, whereby and whereunder, the High Court had disposed of all the matters in light of its judgment and order in R.F.A. No. 2695 of 2002 and connected matters dated 05.11.2012.

5. The lis in this batch pertains to acquisition of various lands situated principally in villages Fatehpur, Maheshpur, Kundli and Railley by the Respondent-State under three different Notifications issued Under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1984 (for short, ""the Act"") in 29.01.1990, 21.12.1994 and 26.04.1995. Since the impugned judgment(s) and order(s) in all the matters have either followed or relied upon the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court in R.F.A. No. 2695 of 2002 (S.L.P. (C) Nos. 26432-26443 of 2013 before this Court), for the sake of convenient disposal of this case, we would only notice the facts in S.L.P. (C) Nos. 26432-26443 of 2013.

6. Brief facts of the leas case are: The Respondent-State had issued a Notification Under Section 4 of the Act to acquire certain lands in the aforesaid villages for the public purpose of development and utilization of land of Panchkula by Haryana Urban Development Authority under the Haryana Urban Development Authority Act, 1977, dated 29.01.1990. After due consideration of the objections filed by the land-loosers Under Section 5-A of the Act, the acquiring authority had recommended issuance of a notification Under Section 6 of the Act to the State Government. Accordingly, the State Government had issued a Notification, declaring that the said land would be acquired for the notified public purpose, dated 25.01.1991.

7. The Land Acquisition Collector (for short, ""the LAC""), by an award dated 11.10.1991, awarded the compensation at the rate of ` 1 lakh per acre in respect of the claimants land.

8. The claimants, not being satisfied with the compensation so awarded by the LAO, approached the latter and sought for a reference Under Section 18 of the Act to the Civil Court for determination of the actual market value of the land acquired by the State Government. The LAC had referred the case of the land-loosers to the Reference Court. The Reference Court determined the market value of the acquired lands at ` 160/- per square yard, by award dated 20.12.2001.

9. Dissatisfied by the aforesaid award, claimants and the Respondent-State filed Regular First Appeals before the High Court.

10. The High Court remanded the said appeals to the Reference Court for fresh adjudication of the market value of the acquired lands by order dated 08.11.2006.

11. Since all the matters were remanded to the Reference Court, it would be appropriate to notice the compensation awarded by the various awards passed by the Reference Court in respect to the lands acquired in the four villages with the common thread of reasoning. The awards dated 10.12.2008, 10.02.2009 and 16.02.2009 qua the properties acquired through notification, dated 29.01.1990, determined the compensation at the rate of ` 394/- per sq. yd., while the awards dated 16.04.2002 and 30.04.2005, qua the properties acquired through notification, dated 26.04.1995, determined the compensation at ` 350/- per sq. yd. and ` 256/- per sq. yd., respectively.

12. Aggrieved by the aforesaid, the claimants approached the High Court in Regular First Appeals for determination of compensation by way of enhancement over the compensation assessed by the Reference Court. Cross appeals were filed by the Respondent-State against the judgment(s) and order(s) passed by the Reference Court.

13. The High Court delved into the basis and principles adopted for valuation of the acquired property by the Reference Court. The High Court has noticed that the aforesaid villages are in close proximity of each other. To assess the fair market value of the acquired lands, the High Court has relied upon the sale transactions in the villages to evaluate the true market value and adopted the principle of averaging to ensure that spikes in prices that are registered through certain transactions in same locality ought not affect the determination of market price for all the properties. Further, considering the fact that the property valuations have been taken up with reference to lands of various sizes and more particularly of smaller plots, the High Court has calculated a deduction at 33.5% towards development charges.

14. In light of the aforesaid, the High Court has taken the average value of the exemplar properties and arrived at the fair market value of ` 551/- per square yard and after deduction of 33.5% towards development charges ascertained the compensation payable at the rate of ` 366/- per square yard, in respect of the lands acquired vide notification dated 29.01.1990. In respect of the notification dated 24.04.1995, the High Court has considered that an escalation of 12% per year requires to be provided for such acquired lands because the properties enure benefit of being situated in an urban locality and proximity to Chandigarh and therefore, enhanced the compensation to ` 600/- per sq. yard. In the result, the High Court has dismissed the appeals filed by the claimants and allowed the cross appeals filed by the State and reduced the compensation awarded by the Reference Court to ` 366/- per square yard.

15. At this juncture it would be pertinent to notice that some of the cases in this batch of appeals relate to notification, dated 21.12.1994. These cases have been disposed of by the High Court in various judgment(s) and order(s) which have followed the decision of the High Court in RFA No. 1022 of 2012, dated 16.10.2012. In RFA No. 1022 of 2012, the High Court, by placing reliance on the judgment and order passed in RFA No. 2695 of 2002 and connected matters, has drawn parity in respect of acquisitions being from the same village and adopted the reasoning in the aforesaid decision. Thus, the High Court has observed that since the exemplar properties were acquired in 1995, the average value would be ` 710/- per square yard and upon 33.5% deduction would amount to ` 473/- per square yard. Taking note of the fact that the compensation awarded by the Reference Court is ` 500/- per square yard and higher than the aforesaid amount, the High Court has continued the said amount as compensation and dismissed the appeals.

16. Aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment(s) and order(s) passed by the High Court, the claimants are before us in these appeals.

17. Heard learned Counsel for the parties to the lis and also perused the judgment(s) and order(s) passed by the Courts below.

18. Since all the cases question the reasoning adopted by the High Court in RFA No. 2695 of 2002 and connected matters, it would be apposite to consider the same only.

19. The Reference Court has considered the contiguity of villages where acquired lands are situated and thereafter considered that the sale transactions produced by the claimants are much prior in time than the award passed by Reference Court in Ravi Kumar v. State of Haryana, where lands in adjoining villages Judian and Kundi were acquired vide notification dated 02.07.1985. In our view, since the said notification is most proximate to the date of notification, that is, 29.01.1990, it would be the best piece of evidence in respect of assessment of fair market value of the lands acquired herein.

20. Further, to ascertain the escalation in prices since earlier notification, the Reference Court has relied upon the judgment of this Court in ONGC Ltd. v. Rameshbhai Jivanbhai Patel MANU/SC/7896/2008MANU/SC/7896/2008 : (2008) 14 SCC 745, wherein this Court has considered the quantum of such escalation per annum and whether it should be assessed at cumulative or flat rate. This Court therein has observed as follows:

""What should be the increase per annum?

***

15. Normally, recourse is taken to the mode of determining the market value by providing appropriate escalation over the proved market value of nearby lands in previous years (as evidenced by sale transactions or acquisitions), where there is no evidence of any contemporaneous sale transactions or acquisitions of comparable lands in the neighbourhood. The said method is reasonably safe where the relied-on sale transactions/acquisitions precede the subject acquisition by only a few years, that is, up to four to five years. Beyond that it may be unsafe, even if it relates to a neighbouring land. What may be a reliable standard if the gap is of only a few years, may become unsafe and unreliable standard where the gap is larger. For example, for determining the market value of a land acquired in 1992, adopting the annual increase method with reference to a sale or acquisition in 1970 or 1980 may have many pitfalls. This is because, over the course of years, the ""rate"" of annual increase may itself undergo drastic change apart from the likelihood of occurrence of varying periods of stagnation in prices or sudden spurts in prices affecting the very standard of increase.

16. Much more unsafe is the recent trend to determine the market value of acquired lands with reference to future sale transactions or acquisitions. To illustrate, if the market value of a land acquired in 1992 has to be determined and if there are no sale transactions/acquisitions of 1991 or 1992 (prior to the date of preliminary notification), the statistics relating to sales/acquisitions in future, say of the years 1994-1995 or 1995-1996 are taken as the base price and the market value in 1992 is worked back by making deductions at the rate of 10% to 15% per annum. How far is this safe? One of the fundamental principles of valuation is that the transactions subsequent to the acquisition should be ignored for determining the market value of acquired lands, as the very acquisition and the consequential development would accelerate the overall development of the surrounding areas resulting in a sudden or steep spurt in the prices. Let us illustrate. Let us assume there was no development activity in a particular area. The appreciation in market price in such area would be slow and minimal. But if some lands in that area are acquired for a residential/commercial/industrial layout, there will be all round development and improvement in the infrastructure/amenities/facilities in the next one or two years, as a result of which the surrounding lands will become more valuable. Even if there is no actual improvement in infrastructure, the potential and possibility of improvement on account of the proposed residential/commercial/industrial layout will result in a higher rate of escalation in prices. As a result, if the annual increase in market value was around 10% per annum before the acquisition, the annual increase of market value of lands in the areas neighbouring the acquired land, will become much more, say 20% to 30%, or even more on account of the development/proposed development. Therefore, if the percentage to be added with reference to previous acquisitions/sale transactions is 10% per annum, the percentage to be deducted to arrive at a market value with reference to future acquisitions/sale transactions should not be 10% per annum, but much more. The percentage of standard increase becomes unreliable. Courts should, therefore, avoid determination of market value with reference to subsequent/future transactions. Even if it becomes inevitable, there should be greater caution in applying the prices fetched for transactions in future. Be that as it may.

***

Whether the increase should be at a cumulative rate or a flat rate?

18. The increase in market value is calculated with reference to the market value during the immediate preceding year. When market value is sought to be ascertained with reference to a transaction which took place some years before the acquisition, the method adopted is to calculate the year to year increase. As the percentage of increase is always with reference to the previous year's market value, the appropriate method is to calculate the increase cumulatively and not applying a flat rate. The difference between the two methods is shown by the following illustration (with reference to a 10% increase over a basic price of ` 10 per square metre):

19. We may also point out that application of a flat rate will lead to anomalous results. This may be demonstrated with further reference to the above illustration. In regard to the sale transaction in 1987, where the price was ` 10 per square metre, if the annual increase to be applied is a flat rate of 10%, the increase will be ` 1 per annum during each of the five years 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992. If the price increase is to be determined with reference to sale transaction of the year 1989 when the price was ` 12 per square metre, the flat rate increase will be ` 1.20 per annum, for the years 1990, 1991 and 1992. If the price increase is determined with reference to a sale transaction of the year 1990 when the price was ` 13 per square metre, then the flat rate increase will be ` 1.30 per annum for the years 1991 and 1992. It will thus be seen that even if the percentage of increase is constant, the application of a flat rate leads to different amounts being added depending upon the market value in the base year. On the other hand, the cumulative rate method will lead to consistency and more realistic results. Whether the base price is Rs. 10 or Rs. 12.10 or Rs. 13.31, the increase will lead to the same result. The logical, practical and appropriate method is therefore to apply the increase cumulatively and not at a flat rate.""

21. In light of the aforesaid view of this Court, the Reference Court has correctly ascertained the premium to be paid at the rate of 12% per annum with cumulative effect from the date of earlier acquisition, dated 02.07.1985 to the acquisition herein, dated 29.01.1990 and therefore, determined the fair market value of acquired lands as ` 394/- per square yards.

22. In our view, the High Court has incorrectly relied upon the sale transactions which date much prior in time than the date of notification and thus, do not reflect the true market value. In the event of an award more proximate to the date of acquisition was available, it would have been proper for the High Court to consider the same as best evidence than the post-dated sale transactions. Thus, in our considered opinion, the judgment and order passed by the High Court does not fairly and adequately assess the compensation payable to the claimants and requires to be set aside and consequently, the judgment and order passed by the Reference Court requires to be restored.

23. Therefore, the judgment and order passed by the High Court is set aside and the judgment and order passed by the Reference Court is restored. In our considered opinion, we deem it appropriate to pass the following order:

WITH REGARD TO ACQUISITION OF 1990

The compensation awarded by the Reference Court i.e., ` 394/- per sq. yard per annum is restored with all statutory benefits on the enhanced amount as provided under the Act.

WITH REGARD TO ACQUISITIONS OF 1995 AND 1994

Taking the base of 1990 acquisition, we fix the compensation at ` 394/- per sq. yard per annum. We also grant 12% escalation to be calculated cumulatively as provided under the Act.

Ordered accordingly.

1. The appeals have been preferred by the accused Appellants against the judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 6.8.2009 passed by the High Court of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh thereby affirming the conviction recorded by the trial court as against the Appellants Under Section 302 read with Section 149 sentencing them to undergo life imprisonment and to pay fine of Rs. 5,000 each; in default to undergo further simple imprisonment for a period of 3 months and Under Section 148 read with Section 302 to undergo RI for one year.

2. In the incident dated 4.7.2003 Partap son of Anand Singh PW5 died. Anand Singh lodged the First Information Report at 4.30 a.m. on 5.7.2003. The incident took place at about 8.30 p.m. It was mentioned in the FIR that Partap had gone to Akhara of the village. As he did not come back, he along with two others Lakhmi Chand and Ramesh went towards Akhara in search of Partap. When they reached near veterinary hospital, they saw Ran Singh and Pinda were quarrelling with Partap. Ran Singh was armed with a Lathi and Pinda with a sword, Roop Chand with a Lathi, Sushil with sword and Anil alias Bawa also armed with a Lathi joined them. They shouted that Partap be taught a lesson for having an evil eye on the lady members of the family of the accused. Sushil and Pinda inflicted injuries on the hands, stomach, waist and chest of Partap. Sushil gave blows of sword to Partap on the head, right hand and on the left of the face of the deceased. Roop Chand and Anil alias Bawa inflicted Lathi blows on the person of Partap. After beating Partap accused fled away. Partap succumbed to his injuries at the place of incident itself.

3. The prosecution examined in all 11 witnesses. Anand Singh PW5 is the complainant. The accused abjured their guilt and contended that as Partap had tried to outrage the modesty of Monika, villagers assembled and gave a beating to Partap due to which he died. The accused were not present at the place of occurrence. They have been falsely implicated in the case. Defence also examined 8 witnesses. The trial court convicted all the 6 accused persons. However, the High Court has acquitted Sandeep as his name was not mentioned in the FIR. He has been given the benefit of doubt. Relying upon the ocular evidence furnished by Anand Singh-PW5, and the medical evidence of Dr. Naresh Dahiya-PW7, and other witnesses related to the investigation it has convicted the remaining 5 accused persons. Three of them are before us in the appeals.

4. It was submitted on behalf of the Appellant that Accused-Appellants have been falsely implicated in the case. Deceased Partap had tried to outrage the modesty of Monika due to which he was beaten by the villagers. The FIR is belated. The house of the accused was set on fire on the same day. Savitri, wife of accused Roop Chand has filed a complaint Under Sections 323, 325, 436, 427, 307, 148, 149 and 452 of Indian Penal Code against family members of deceased Partap. The witnesses Lakhmi Chand and Ramesh have not been examined whereas they were named in the first information report as such adverse inference deserves to be drawn against the prosecution. The guilt has not been established beyond periphery of doubt by the prosecution.

5. It was contended by learned Counsel appearing for the State of Haryana that both the courts have appreciated the evidence and concurred with the finding that the deceased Partap was mercilessly beaten and murdered by the accused Appellants. Considering the number of injuries which were sustained by deceased Partap and the ocular version is supported by the medical evidence. Conviction has been rightly recorded. Other two witnesses were not examined as they were won over by the accused. The statement of the complainant Anand Singh PW5 who was an eye witness to the incident has been found to be worthy of reliance. Defence evidence has also been taken into consideration. The conviction and sentence is absolutely proper and does not call for interference.

6. We have gone through the judgment as well as the evidence placed on record. It is apparent from statement of eye-witness Anand Singh-PW5, that the deceased Partap was given beating by accused Sushil, Anil alias Bawa and Roop Chand. Sushil had inflicted injuries with the help of a sword on the person of deceased Partap on various parts of the body. Roop Chand and Bawa inflicted several Lathi blows. The ocular version that the aforesaid persons had inflicted the injuries with weapons in question due to which Partap died has been corroborated medically by Dr. Naresh Dahiya-PW7. He has clearly stated that injury Nos. 1 to 10 were caused by sharp-edged weapon and the contusion in the form of a Lathi mark on the back, right side and multiple bruises and contusions in the form of Lathi marks on the front chest and both arms were caused by blunt object like Lathi. Thus the version of Anand Singh-PW5, being father of the deceased is quite reliable. He would be the last person to spare the actual assailant and would not implicate the accused falsely. He had no enmity with accused persons. It has been found that the delay in lodging the FIR has been satisfactorily explained, being father of deceased he became unwell for two hours after death of his son. It also appears that another incident of setting fire to the house of accused had taken place in the same night with respect to which report had been lodged by Savitri wife of accused Roop Chand. The trial court as well as the High Court have found that the outcome of the murder of the deceased Partap at the hands of accused persons was that house of accused was set ablaze for which report had been lodged by Savitri.

7. In the FIR it was mentioned that deceased Partap was given beating on the allegation that he had an evil eye on the women-folk of the family of the accused. In the circumstances, the accused persons came armed with swords and Lathis and had caused large number of injuries on the person of the deceased Partap due to which he succumbed to death on the spot itself. The accused persons had no right to take law into their hands and to beat Partap mercilessly and intentionally to cause his death.

8. The prosecution had not examined the two witnesses namely Ramesh and Lakhmi Chand. However in the instant case the version of Anand Singh PW5 is found to be reliable. Learned Counsel for the Appellants has relied upon The State of U.P. and Anr. v. Jaggo alias Jagdish and Ors. [MANU/SC/0190/1971MANU/SC/0190/1971 : AIR 1971 SC 1586] to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution for non-examination of the aforesaid witnesses. Drawing of an adverse inference is dependent upon the facts and circumstances of each case. In the instant case the version of the father of the deceased is found to be reliable and he had no motive to implicate the accused falsely and appears to be a truthful witness.

9. Learned Counsel has also placed reliance on Bahal Singh v. State of Haryana [MANU/SC/0091/1976MANU/SC/0091/1976 : AIR 1976 SC 2032] so as to contend that being related and chance witness, the version of Anand Singh PW5 is not acceptable. In the case of Bahal Singh (supra), the best evidence was kept behind and it was held that same had prejudiced a fair trial. Certain circumstances were also not put to the accused which was also considered to be a grave irregularity. In our opinion, it would depend upon the facts of each case whether the accused has received a fair trial. As Anand Singh had gone towards Akhara in search of his son along with others could not be said to be unusual as he had to water the fields along with Partap, his son. Reading of the entire statement of Anand Singh-PW5, inspires confidence and both the courts below have accepted the version after full appreciation of the evidence and there are no inherent improbabilities in the version unfolded by witness. Thus, in our considered opinion, conviction has rightly been recorded by the courts below which calls for no interference in the appeals. It cannot be said that the accused have not received fair trial in the instant case.

10. We find no ground to interfere in the appeals. The appeals being devoid of merit, deserve to be and are hereby dismissed.

P. Venkatarama Reddi, J.

1.1 These appeals by special leave preferred by the Union of India are directed against the common judgment of the Bombay High Court in a batch of writ petitions filed under Article 226 of the Constitution by the manufacturers/importers of certain bulk drugs and their formulations. The bulk drugs concerned are seven in number. They are: Salbutamol, Theophylline, Cyproflaxacin, Norfloxacin, Cloxacillin, Doxycycline and Glipizide. These bulk drugs and the formulations made out of them are sold within the country and part of the quantities produced are also exported outside the country. The challenge is to the inclusion of the said bulk drugs in the first schedule to the Drugs (Price Control) Order, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as 'the DPCO'). Though the fixation of priced pursuant to the provisions of the said Order was also challenged in some of the writ petitions, that issue was not gone into by the High Court and at any rate, the mechanics of price fixation is not the contentious issue before us. However, it may be noted that the remedy by way of review is available under paragraph 22 of the DPCO to seek reconsideration of price fixation. The immediate provocation for filing the writ petitions in the High court seems to be the notices issued by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority, calling upon some of the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority, calling upon some of the Respondent-Companies to deposit the overcharged amounts in relation to the formulations of scheduled drugs.

1.2 The High Court held that the concerned drugs should not have been brought within the purview of the DPCO, 1995 and consequently, there could be no fixation of price in relation to those drugs. The notices demanding overcharged amounts were quashed. The writ petitions were thus allowed by the Division Bench of High Court.

2.1 The DPCO, 1995 which came into force on 6th January, 1995, was promulgated by the Central Government in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act. It repealed the earlier DPCO of 1987, under which more number of drugs were subjected to price control. 'Drug' as defined in Drugs & Cosmetics Act is one of the essential commodities.

2.2 According to Section 2(a) of DPCO, 'Bulk Drug' means any pharmaceutical, chemical, biological or plant product including its salts, esters, stereo-isomers and derivatives, conforming to pharmacopoeia or other standards specified in the Second Schedule to the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and which is used as such or as an ingredient in any formulation. 'Formulation' is defined to mean a medicine processed out of, or containing one of more bulk drug or drugs with or without the use of any pharmaceutical aids, for internal or external use in the diagnosis, treatment, mitigation or prevention of disease in human beings or animals.

2.3 Paragraph 3 of DPCO empowers the Central Government to fix, from time to time, a maximum sale price at which the bulk drug specified in the first schedule shall be sold, after making such inquiry, as it deems fit. The opening clause of sub-para (1) spells out the avowed purpose of price control on the scheduled bulk drugs. The declared objective is to regulate the equitable distribution and increasing supplies of the specified bulk drug and making them available at a fair price. There is a prohibition against the sale of bulk drug at a price exceeding the maximum sale price fixed under sub-paragraph (1) plus local taxes, if any. As already observed, we are not concerned here with the modalities of fixation of price. The very inclusion of these bulk drugs in the schedule is being assailed on the ground that it is opposed to the norms laid down by the Central Government itself in the Drug Policy of 1994 and, therefore, the delegated legislative power exercised by the Government is arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. The plea of the respondents was accepted by the High Court.

2.4 In the Drug Policy document issued on 15th September, 1994, the Central Government noticed that during the last decade, the drug industry had grown significantly in terms of production of bulk drugs and formulations and the export performance of the industry had been commendable. It was said that the pharmaceutical sector had been able to carve a special niche for itself in the international market as a dependable exporter of bulk drugs. The drug policy with regard to pricing has been stated thus in paragraph 9 of the policy Paper:

""9. Pricing--The aberrations which have come to notice, in the listing of drugs and their categorization for the purpose of price control, need to be eliminated by the use of transparent criteria applied across the board on all the drugs with the minimum use of subjectively. The high turnover of a drug is in index of its extent of usage and is considered to meet the requirements of objectivity justifiable on economic considerations. However, the monopoly situation in cases of drugs with comparatively lower turnover has also to be kept in view. Also, as an experimental measure, drugs having adequate competition may not be kept under price control and if this proves successful it would pave the way for further liberalization. In the event, however, of prices of these drugs not remaining within reasonable limits, the Government would reclaim price control.""

In paragraph 11, it is stated--

""In the light of the apprehensions expressed in the Parliament on the likely spurt in the pieces of medicines, it has benefit that it would not be desirable to allow automatically in the pricing mechanism. The Government would set up an independent body of experts, to be called the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority, to do the work of price fixation. This expert body would also be entrusted with the task of updating the list of drugs under price control each year on the basis of the established criteria/guidelines.....""

2.5 The Government's resolve to closely monitor the trends of prices of medicines and to take appropriate measures to reclaim price control in case the prices of such medicines rise unreasonably, has been stressed in paragraph 12. Then, we come to the most important paragraph in the Drug Policy i.e., 22.7.2 which bears the heading 'Span of Control'. It sets out the criteria for bringing the drugs under price control. We quote paragraph 22.7.2:-

22.7.2. Span of Control--

(i) The criteria of including drugs under price control would be the minimum annual turnover of Rs. 400 lakhs.

(ii) Drugs of popular use in which there is a monopoly situation be kept under price control. For this purpose for any bulk drug, having an annual turnover of Rs. 100 lakhs or more there is a single formulator having 90% or more market share in the Retail Trade (as per ORG) a monopoly situation would be considered as existing.

(iii) Drugs in which there is sufficient market competition viz., at least 5 bulk drug producers and at least 10 formulators and none having more than the 40% market share in the Retail Trade (as per ORG) may be kept outside the price control. However, a strict watch would be kept on the movement of prices as it is expected that their prices would be kept in check by the forces of market competition. The Government may determine the ceiling levels beyond which increase in prices would not be permissible.

(iv) Government will keep a close watch on the prices of medicines which are taken out of price control. In case, the prices of these medicines rise unreasonably, the Government would take appropriate measures, including reclaim of price control.

(v) For applying the above criteria, to start with, the basis would be the data upto 31st March, 1990 collected for the exercise of the Review of the Drug Policy. The updating of the data will be done by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority as detailed in para 22.7.4(i).

3. The central theme of the arguments is that the norms set out in sub-Paras (i), (ii) & (iii) have not been adhered to by the Government while framing the first schedule to DPCO in purported implementation of the drug policy. There was either deviation from the criteria set out or there was no scientific or rational assessment of the factors relevant to the norms. Most of the arguments centered round the interpretation of the three clauses in para 22.7.2--an exercise which is usually associated with the construction of statutes. The sum and substance of the arguments on behalf of the respondents is that the seven bulk drugs get excluded from the span of control under one or more norms spelt out in para 22.7.2, whereas the stand of the appellants is that the concerned bulk drugs were included in the schedule only after being satisfied that they came within the ambit of price control criteria. It is also the contention of the appellant that the Government's decision to bring these important bulk drugs within price control is in accordance with the objectives underlying in Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act, particularly, the interests of consumers. Every attempt was made to examine the facts and figures by an Expert Group of the standing committee, keeping in view the prescribed norms in Drug Policy. It is pointed out that the High Court cannot go into the intricacies of price fixation under Article 226 of the Constitution or sit in judgment over the exercise done by experts.

4.1 It is axiomatic that the contents of a policy documents cannot be read and interpreted as statutory provisions. Too much of legalism cannot be imported in understanding the scope and meaning of the clauses contained in Policy formulations. At the same time, the Central Government which combines the dual role of policy-maker and the delegate of legislative power, cannot at its sweet will and pleasure give a go-bye to the policy guidelines evolved by itself in the matter of selection of drugs for price control. The Government itself stressed the need to evolve and adopt transparent criteria to be applied across the board so as to minimize the scope for subjective approach and therefore came forward with specific criteria. It is nobody's case that for any good reasons, the policy or norms have been changed or became impracticable of compliance. That being the case, the Government exercising its delegated legislative power should make a real and earnest attempt to apply the criteria laid down by itself. The delegated legislation that follows the policy formulation should be broadly and substantially in conformity with that policy; otherwise it would be vulnerable to attack on the ground of arbitrariness resulting in violation of Article 14.

4.2 In Indian Express Newspapers v. Union of India , the grounds on which subordinate legislation can be questioned were outlined by this Court. E.S. Venkataramiah, J. observed thus:

""A piece of subordinate legislation does not carry the same degree of immunity which is enjoyed by a statute passed by a competent Legislature. Subordinate legislation may be questioned on any of the ground on which plenary legislation is questioned. In addition it may also be questioned on the ground that it does not conform to the statute under which it is made.

* * *

It may also be questioned on the ground that it is unreasonable, unreasonable not in the sense of not being reasonable, but in the sense that it is manifestly arbitrary. In England, the Judges would say ""Parliament never intended authority to make such rules. They are unreasonable and ultra vires.""

4.3 True, the breach of policy decision by itself is not a ground to invalidate delegated legislation. But, in a case like this, the inevitable fallout of the breach of policy decision which the Government itself treated as a charter for the resultant legislation is to leave an imprint of arbitrariness on the legislation. When the selection or classification of certain drugs is involved for the purpose of price control, such selection or classification should be on rational basis and cannot be strikingly arbitrary. No doubt, in such matters, wide latitude is conceded to the legislature or its delegate. Broadly, the subordinate law-making authority is guided by the policy and objectives of primary legislation disclosed by preamble and other provisions. The delegated legislation need not be modelled on a set pattern or pre-fixed guidelines. However, where the delegate goes a step further, draws up and announces a rational policy in keeping with the purposes of enabling legislation and even lays down specific criteria to promote the policy, the criteria so evolved become the guide-posts for its legislative action. In that sense, its freedom of classification will be regulated by the self-evolved criteria and there should be demonstrable justification for deviating therefrom. Though exactitude and meticulous conformance is not what is required, it is not open to the Government to go hay-wire and flout or debilitate the set norms either by giving distorted meaning to them or by disregarding the very facts and factors which it professed to take into account in the interest of transparency and objectivity. Otherwise, the legislative act of the delegate in choosing some drugs for price control while leaving others will attract the wrath of Article 14. That is why the Union of India has taken the stand throughout that it stood by the policy while framing the legislation and that there was every endeavour to apply the criteria spelt out in the Drug Policy of 1994 before including the drugs in question in the first schedule. The correctness of this contention should, of course, be examined.

5.1 With this prologue, let us proceed to analyze the three relevant criteria in the drug policy. According to the first criteria, for bringing the drugs under the price control, the minimum annual turnover of the drug should be 400 lacs. However, this requirement is qualified by and subject to the criteria laid down in (ii) & (iii). Where a monopoly situation prevails in respect of any bulk drug, the minimum annual turnover requirement gets reduced to 100 lacs. The monopoly situation is deemed to exist where there is a single formulator commanding 90% or more market share in the retail trade ( as per ORG data). According to the 3rd criterion, even if minimum annual turnover exceeds 400 lacs, the drug will be kept outside price control in case there is sufficient market competition. The yardstick rhea assessing whether there is sufficient market competition, according to Clause (iii) is that there are at least five producers of the particular bulk drug and at least ten formulators and none of them have more than 40% market share in the retail trade (as per ORG data).

The said criteria have to be worked out with reference to the data available upto 31st March, 1990 which means, the relevant facts and figures relating to financial year 1989-90 have to be taken into account. This is not in dispute.

5.2 already noted, there is no quarrel about the criteria that has been laid down. It is not the case of the Union of India that any different criteria had been applied while promulgating the DPCO of 1995. The controversy revolves round its actual application or methodology of working out the criteria. What is the annual turnover made up of? In other words, how to work out the turnover figures? Is there sufficient market competition as contemplated by Clause (iii)? It is with reference to these two aspects that the Government's stand has not been accepted and the writ petitioner's contention found its acceptance by the High Court.

5.3 First, we shall take up the issue of 'annual turnover'. The stand of the appellant, as discernible from the affidavits on record sworn to by the officials of the Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals, Government of India is that the turnover of bulk drug ought not to be mixed up with retail sale data of the formulations of that bulk drug; in other words, the retail sale data pertains to formulations of bulk drug and not to the bulk drug itself. The broad manner in which the turnover has been assessed is indicated in paragraph 8 of the rejoinder affidavit filed in SLPs. It is stated that the expert group of the Standing Committee which went into the whole issue of exclusion/inclusion of drugs under price control ""took the date for turnover of the bulk drugs comprising of the value of its total production in the country and value of weighted average of landed cost of total imports into the country, as the basis for viewing the price scenario from different points of view"". It is then stated in paragraph 10 - ""In the further respectful submission of the petitioner the intent behind using the said word (turnover) has been to determine the extent of usage of a bulk drug in the country (emphasis supplied). This was the measure adopted by the expert group in case of each bulk drug by taking into account the aggregate of its total imports into the country and its total indigenous production in the country. This has been the connotation of the word 'turnover' at various levels throughout the deliberations and in implementation of the policy through DPCO 1995 and was never confined to the narrow connotation of the word 'sales turnover'"". In short, it is submitted (vide paragraph 13) that the value of total production plus imports of the bulk drug in the country determines the annual turnover for the purpose of Clauses (i) & (ii) of para 22.7.2. As a corollary to this stand, the contention advanced on behalf of the Union of India is that export sales could also be taken into account in arriving at the annual turnover. According to the respondents (writ petitioners), the annual turnover could only mean sales of bulk drug within the country either in the same form or by way of formulations and it has nothing to do with export sales. The entirety of production and imports cannot be regarded as turnover. It is submitted by the respondents that the bulk drugs are sold mostly in the form of formulations and the quantities of bulk drugs utilized in such formulations are given in ORG data. From this, the bulk drug turnover can be easily ascertained. The sales of the bulk drugs as such to the institutions etc., will be negligible i.e., about 15%, as per the certificate issued by ORG in one of the cases. It is, therefore, commented that the contention that the ORG data does not afford the basis for ascertaining the annual turnover of the bulk drug, is untenable.

5.4 The High court, substantially agreeing with the contentions of the respondents--writ petitioners held that the expression 'turnover' occurring in Drugs Policy can only mean domestic sales figures and nothing else. Export sales cannot be included within the ambit of turnover. The High Court observed that the concepts of 'turnover' and 'market share' are interrelated and inter-dependent. The expression 'turnover', if interpreted in a contextual and purposive manner, would not include exports. The extent of usage of the bulk drug in the country would be determinative of turnover. By taking the export sale figures and the value of entire production of bulk drugs into account, the Central Government had acted contrary to its own guidelines contained in Drug Policy, 1994. The High Court then proceeded to discuss whether each of the drugs concerned could be brought within the purview of DCPO, 1995 and answered that question in favour of the writ petitioners.

5.5 Before proceeding further, we may notice that the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) constituted by the Government of India considered the representation of Bulk Drugs Manufacturers Association (BDMA) on the subject of inclusion/exclusion of drugs under DPCO. The NPPA passed a reasoned order rejected the representation on dt. 6.4.1998. In that order, the issues raised by BDMA regarding exclusion of six out of eight drugs with which we are concerned, were considered by the said authority. There was however no consideration as regards two drugs, namely, Doxycycline and Glipizide, probably because the representation did not cover those two drugs.

5.6 Before we take up the issue of export sales, it is necessary to understand the true import and expanse of the expression 'turnover' occurring in Clause (i) of para 22.7.2 of the Drug Policy, 1994. What is the 'turnover' contemplated by the said paragraph? Can it be equated to the value of imported bulk drug and its production, as contended by the appellant OR should it be equated to the actual sales within the country? Should the export sales be included in turnover? These are the questions to which this Court has to address itself.

5.7 'Turnover' in its ordinary sense connotes amount of business usually expressed in terms of gross revenue transacted during a specified period (vide Collins Dictionary). Broadly speaking, it represents the value of the goods or services sold or supplied during a period of time. The amount of money turned over or drawn in a business during certain period, is another shade of meaning. We need not refer to the definition of 'turnover' in Sales tax and other fiscal enactments--reliance on which was placed by some of the learned counsel as they are not quite relevant for the purpose of understanding the expression 'turnover' occurring in a policy document. Nor should we seek any assistance from the definition of 'sale turnover' occurring in DPCO in a different context and for a different purpose. Going by its ordinary meaning and the way in which it is commonly understood in trade and commerce, it is difficult to equate turnover to the value of stock acquired either by means of imports or production. For instance, the entire stock in trade, say, lying in a godown and not circulated in business, cannot be regarded as turnover, even giving broadest meaning to the expression 'turnover'. The reasoning which could be spelt out from the order passed by NPPA (referred to supra) and in the counter affidavits filed by the appellants that indigenous production plus imports furnishes an indicia of the total business in the country in relation to a particular bulk drug, cannot be accepted. It is only what is sold out and marketed that could be legitimately regarded as turnover of the specified drug. It may be that in the absence of availability of reliable data regarding sales, the import value and production value could be the basis to estimate the sale value after giving due allowance to various factors such as wastage, unsold stocks etc. But, treating the turnover as nothing but the value of stock produced or imported during a given period will be doing violence to the ordinarily accepted meaning of the expression 'turnover'. There can be no presumption that the entire stock of bulk drug produced or imported during the year had been sold out during that year either in the form of formulations or otherwise. However, we would like to make it clear that the production and import statistics are not altogether irrelevant. They are relevant in the sense that they furnish some basis for estimating the sales when there is no other reliable and comprehensive data of sales available.

5.8 The question whether export sales should also be taken into account in computing the annual turnover needs to be discussed now. There can be no doubt that the meaning of the expression 'turnover' either in its ordinary or legal sense includes export sales. But, we must have regard to the terms and objectives of the policy and try to understand that expression accordingly. Para 9 of the Drug Policy, 1994 makes it clear that the high turnover of a drug is an index of its extent of usage. 'Usage' has obvious reference to consumption and consumption within the domestic market. Whether the drug is extensively used within the country is one of the considerations kept in view to clamp price control. The export potential of the drug or its usage in foreign countries could not have been the reason to notify the specified drugs for price control. If there is any doubt in this regard, it is dispelled by what is stated in paragraph 10 of the rejoinder affidavit which we quoted supra. To repeat, it was stated therein that the intent behind using the word 'turnover' has been to determine the extent of usage of a bulk drug in the country. It is also pertinent to note that the Govt. of India has not come forward with any explanation as to why export sales also should be taken into account in assessing the turnover as per the criteria laid down in the Drug Policy. For all these reasons, we are in agreement with the High Court that the export sales ought to have been excluded while calculating the turnover. How far the exclusion of export sales would make any difference is a different matter.

5.9 Another grey area which has surfaced in the backdrop of the Drug Policy, 1994 is whether for the purpose of Clause (iii), the expression 'formulators' should be confined to single ingredient formulators or it should extend to multi-ingredient formulators as well. The NPPA while rejecting the representation of the Bulk Drug Manufacturers' Association, referred to the clarification issued by the Government of India in its communication dated 10.6.197 addressed to one of the writ petitioners which is as follows:

""The basis of the single ingredient formulation as against that of the combination formulation (for purpose of calculating market share), is not only justified on account of predominance of single ingredient formulation, on over all basis, but also vindicates the objective of ""promoting the rational use of drugs in the country"" mentioned in paragraph 1(b) of the ""Modifications in Drug Policy, 1986"". The Principle of covering only single ingredient formulations, for purposes of calculating market share is a transparent, objective and verifiable principle and hence suitable for policy issues. Formulations of a bulk drug, containing one or more other bulk drug are not comparable in terms of their sales values. therefore, it is practically not possible to apply the criteria relating to market share of a formulator of a bulk drug on the basis of data of its combination formulations, across the board, in a transparent, objective and verifiable manner as required for policy issues.""

It is, therefore, contended by the Union of India that only single ingredient formulations have to be taken into account for the purpose of working out the criterion in Clause (iii) and that the number of single ingredient formulators of the concerned bulk drug is not discernible from ORG data. Of course, it is the contention of the respondents that no such distinction can be drawn. It is contended that such distinction is irrational.

In our view, the clarification given by the Government of India reflects a reasonable view point and it cannot be said that by adopting such approach, a distorted meaning is given to the expression 'formulator' much against the spirit of the policy. At any rate, two views are possible and it is not for the Court to decide which view is preferable.

6. Before closing the discussion on the controversies surrounding the criteria evolved in the Drug Policy, there is one argument of the learned Solicitor General which we would like to refer to. The learned Solicitor General argued that the expression 'may' occurring in Clause (iii) of para 22.7.2 of the Drug Policy confers discretion and flexibility in approach to the Government of India. Even if a particular bulk drug stands outside price control by the application of such criteria, the discretion is still left to the Government to include the drug in the Schedule for good reasons. This argument cannot be countenanced for the simple reason that it is not the case of the Government that for any particular reason or reasons, the bulk drug concerned was brought within the purview of price control, though the drug qualifies for exclusion under Clause (iii). Even assuming that the discretion is available in terms of the policy, the factum of exercising such discretion for relevant reasons should be disclosed. In the absence of such disclosure, the Court must proceed on the basis that the Government stood by the criteria and saw no need to deviate therefrom.

7.1 Now it is necessary to advert to the nature of the claim made by the writ petitioners in relation to each of the bulk drugs, the stand taken by the Union of India and the conclusions of the High Court.

7.2 Salbutamol: According to the writ petitioner-Company, the annual turnover for the year ending March, 1990 was Rs. 171.17 lacs based on the ORG data. The sales of formulations in domestic market has been taken as the basis to calculate the consumption. It is then multiplied by the notified price prevalent during the relevant period. It is the further case of the writ petitioner that there was as many as 24 formulations including the petitioner, none of whom had the market share of more than 40%. Admittedly, there were more than five bulk drug producers. The writ petitioner-Company, therefore, claimed the benefit of exclusion both under Clause (i) and (iii) of para 22.7.2 of the Drug Policy, 1994. The Government of India took the stand that the bulk drug turnover was Rs. 11.50 crores based on the value of domestic production and imports. Moreover, there were only seven known formulators of the bulk drug. therefore, it is contended that the drug Salbutamol does not qualify for exclusion either under Clause (i) or (iii). The High Court accepted the claim of the petitioner-Company on the ground that in the counter affidavit filed by the Union of India, there was only a bald denial and the details given by the writ petitioners were not controverted.

7.3 Theophylline: The writ petitioners claimed exclusion under Clause (iii). The names of six bulk drug producers and 31 formulators were given in the writ petition. In the counter affidavit, it was merely stated that there were less than five known manufacturers of bulk drug and less than 10 known formulators of the bulk drug and therefore the drug. Theophylline did not qualify for exclusion under Clause (iii). The High Court observed that the particulars furnished by the petitioner were not effectively controverted, there being only a bald denial. It was therefore held that the drug ought not to have been brought under price control.

As per the statement furnished by the learned Solicitor General at the time of hearing, the fact that there were more than five bulk drug producers, was accepted but the number of formulators was given as seven. therefore, the dispute is confined to the number of formulators, the term 'formulator' being understood in the sense in which the Government of India explained in its clarificatory letter dated 6-4-1998.

7.4 Cloxacillin: The writ petitioners concerned are said to be the manufacturers of formulations made out of Cloxacillin. There is no dispute that the annual turnover at the relevant time was much more than 400 lacs. The writ petitioners claimed exclusion of the drug Cloxacillin on the basis of Clause (iii) of para 22.7.2. According to them, there were as many as 16 bulk drug procedures and 23 formulators in respect of Cloxacillin and none of the formulators had more than 40% market share as per the ORG figures for the year 1989-90 (upto March 1990). The High Court accepted the case of the petitioners on the ground that the factual particulars were not controverted, but there was only a bald denial in the counter affidavit filed by Union of India. The counter affidavit of Union of India is not found either in S.L.P. paper books or the original record of High Court. However, the stand of Union of India, as is clear from the reply dated 6.4.1998 of the NPPA sent to the Bulk Drug Manufacturers' Association as well as the Grounds of SLP is that the number of single ingredient formulators of the drug was less than 10. According to the statement furnished by the learned Solicitor General in the course of the arguments, the number of formulators were only two. The NPPA clarified the position thus:

""The Association has claimed that the highest market share of single formulator is 21.89%. This claim is based on consideration of sale values of both single ingredient and combination products of Cloxacillin. However, the highest market share of single drug ingredient formulation of a particular formulator works out to 93.07% which is more than the stipulated level of 40%.""

Thus, there is controversy regarding the number of formulators and their market share.

7.5 Cyproflaxacin: The 2nd petitioner in writ petition No. 3449 of 1996, namely, Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. produced "
"

A.K. Sikri, J.

1. In the present writ petition filed by the Petitioners Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India, the Petitioners who are migrants of the State of Jammu & Kashmir (hereinafter referred to as the 'migrants') state that they had planned to take out a peaceful protest march upto Delhi for ventilating their grievances. However, when they reached near Katra in Jammu & Kashmir, the Respondent authorities through their police personnel had beaten up and manhandled these migrants in a most brutal and barbaric manner on 07.08.2007. It is the allegation of the Petitioners that this incident has violated their rights guaranteed to them under Articles 14, 19, 21 and 22 of the Constitution of India and prayers are made in the petition for taking criminal action against the erring officials, including Respondent Nos. 3 to 9, and also to pay compensation to each of the Petitioners and other Jammu migrants who suffered serious injuries, in the sum of Rs. 10 lakhs. Prayer is also made to order the special investigation into the said episode of 07.08.2007.

2. Giving detail background of the grievances of the migrants leading to the said incident, it is mentioned that Ms. Anita Thakur, Petitioner No. 1, is a General Secretary of the Jammu & Kashmir Panthers Party whereas Petitioner No. 2 is an Advocate and also the Secretary of the said Party, who have been espousing the cause of the Jammu migrants (about 2200 families) who were forced to leave their homes between 1996-1999 in view of the terrorist attacks on these families. Third Petitioner is a senior Journalist who was also assaulted and arrested on 07.08.2007 for giving media coverage of the incident in question.

According to the Petitioners, these migrants are living in most miserable conditions and it became difficult for them to survive. Out of these 2200 migrant families, about 950 families have been residing in broken huts of Talwara camp. For redressal of their grievances, a writ petition in the nature of PIL (PIL No. 534/1999) was filed in the High Court of Jammu & Kashmir wherein order dated 06.09.2002 was passed by the High Court directing that persons from Poonch, Rajouri, Doda, Udhampur and Jammu provinces, who had suffered and been forced to migrate on account of militancy would be entitled to the same treatment as migrants from the Kashmir Valley. This order was challenged by the State of Jammu & Kashmir by filing SLP (C) No. 34/2003 in this Court. In that SLP, the order dated 12.07.2006 was passed to the following effect:

Pursuant to our direction, the Relief Commissioner (Migrants) filed an affidavit on 03.12.2004 and in the affidavit the details are given regarding the relief measures given to the Kashmir migrants and it is stated that the relief is being provided to various migrants who are Kashmiri migrants and to migrants other than Kashmiri migrants. In view of the averments stated in the affidavit, we do not find any necessity to give further directions. However, counsel for the Respondents stated that some of the migrants are not being regularly paid the relief measures and since March 2004 they are not given any benefits. The Relief Commissioner may look into the matter and see whether they have been provided with all relief measures to which they are entitled as per the policy. If there are lapses on the part of the officials or any arrears to be paid to the migrants, the same shall be made available to them at the earliest. The Relief Commissioner would be at liberty to consider the migrant status of any person and if it is found that if such persons are not real migrants he would be at liberty to deny the relief measures to such persons. With these directions, the appeal is disposed of.

3. It is averred in the petition that in spite of the aforesaid order directing the Relief Commissioner to look into the complaints by migrants, who claimed that they were not regularly provided relief measures since March 2004 and to provide all benefits to them, including arrears, if any, no positive action was taken by the Respondents. This forced the Petitioners to submit a memorandum to the Deputy Commissioner, Reasi stating that if the order was not implemented within 15 days, the migrants would resort to their protest march to Delhi and would meet the Prime Minister of India for implementation of this order. This was followed by another representation dated 23.07.2007 to the Chief Minister, Jammu & Kashmir wherein they threatened that on the Government failure to implement the order, the migrants would go on strike.

As nothing happened, on 31.07.2007, the Talwara migrants started their peaceful protest march from Talwara towards Jammu to head to Delhi. According to the Petitioners, the migrants were stopped about 6 kms. short of Katra town, at Ghar Baba Jitto, after they had covered about 20 kms towards Jammu. Police kept them in siege for 5 days. The protest marchers who were about 2000 in number including old persons, women and children were not allowed to proceed and were made to sit at that place till 07.08.2007, the fateful day. On 07.08.2007, following events occurred:

(i) At about 1 pm on this day, the three Petitioners (all members of the Jammu & Kashmir National Panthers Party) arrived at Katra, to speak with the concerned authorities regarding the plight of the migrants.

(ii) The Petitioners conducted a one hour long discussion with the Dy. Commissioner, Reasi, the Tehsildar, Reasi, Superintendent of Police, Reasi and the SHO, Katra regarding the migrants' peaceful march.

(iii) The migrants resumed their peaceful march, and the Petitioners joined the march to ensure that there was no undue harassment by the Police.

(iv) At about 2 pm, 500 armed policemen, blocked the bridge that the migrants were about to cross and began attacking the marchers with Lathis and teargas shells.

(v) Petitioner No. 2 attempted to approach the Police which included Respondent Nos. 6 to 9 to stop the attack, and was taken into custody after being brutally assaulted and having his leg broken. He stayed in Police custody without medical aid till 9 pm when he was taken first to Katra Government Hospital and then shifted to Government Medical Hospital, Jammu at 11.30 pm. Petitioner No. 1 then attempted to approach the Police to secure medical aid for the injured migrants. As soon as she entered the Police control zone, she was violently attacked by several police women, dragged on the ground for a long distance and put into a Police jeep. Petitioner No. 1 was beaten inside the jeep and also at the Police Station. Petitioner No. 3 was also arrested for trying to cover the incident.

4. Petitioner No. 1 was admitted to the Government Medical College Hospital, Jammu on 08.08.2007. Copies of medical reports of Petitioner No. 1 have been filed by the Petitioners. The Bar Association of Jammu & Kashmir also started protest against the aforesaid criminal assault on Petitioner No. 2 by abstaining from Courts on 09.08.2007. Petitioner Nos. 2 and 3 were released on interim bail on 10.08.2007 by the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Katra pursuant to the directions of the High Court and were thereafter granted regular bail on 14.08.2007.

5. The Petitioners filed contempt petition No. 155/2007 alleging violation of this Court's order dated 13.07.2006 wherein notice was issued by this Court on 20.08.2007. Thereafter, present petition was filed with the prayers as aforesaid, in which show cause notice was issued on 01.10.2007.

6. The Respondents have appeared and denied the version of the Petitioners. The official version which has surfaced on record in the form of response to the various averments made in the writ petition is that about 500 migrants on 01.08.2007 blocked the Reasi-Pouni road near Baradari bringing the entire traffic on stand still. Dharna continued the entire day and night and the unruly crowd damaged a police vehicle. Leaders of the Panther's party in discussions with the administration agreed to lift the Dharna. However, they back tracked and the dharna continued. On 02.08.2007, protestors started marching towards Katra. Administration at Sula Park requested them to go back. All offers of relief were turned down. On 03.08.2007, High Officials of the State reached Serwad and persuaded the crowd to adopt a realistic and pragmatic approach. Suggestions of providing ration and cash relief for three months at par with border migrants were given. Migrants initially agreed to it and it was decided to gather at Aghar Jitto temple where the ration shall be distributed on the same day. However, the migrants later refused the offer and demanded cash relief at par with Kashmiri migrants. High Officials camped at Serwad on 03/04.08.2007 to persuade the migrants. On 05/06.08.2007, negotiations continued. Directions were given to provide facilities of water, medicine, food along with milk packets for infants. Some of the demonstrators accepted the relief of the Government. However, insofar as Petitioners are concerned, instead of amicably sorting out the issue, raised a new demand for providing arrears for last 40 months. Police authorities informed the migrants that the competent authority shall be informed and that they should return peacefully and not march ahead to disturb the on going Amarnath and Vishnu Devi Yatris. The agitated protestors, however, took strategic positions alongside the road and started pelting stones on the police personnels who were trying to initiate dialogues. Few of them even used their Lathis which they were carrying. The crowd marched towards Balni Bridge where the police contingent reorganized. However, the demonstrators had turned violent and wanted to proceed to Katra. Keeping in view the security and in face of no other option, police resorted to mild Lathi charge to control the mob. The injured migrants and the policemen were taken to PHC-Katra. 17 Policemen along with Mr. Ashok Sharma (Respondent No. 6) got severely injured and were rushed to the hospital as well. Executive Magistrate Tehsildar, Reasi after taking stock of the situation and attack on the police authorities by the mob and the resulted injuries on police officers and civilians ordered SP Katra for Lathi charge and use of tear smoke to disperse the unruly mob. In the melee some persons from the mob including Mr. Jhalmeria got injured. Respondent No. 6 was injured by the mob and was taken to the hospital. Respondent No. 7 was manhandled by Petitioner No. 1 who tore and threw away his ranks from his uniform.

7. It becomes clear from the above that both the parties are accusing each other. At the time of hearing, counsel for the parties stuck to their respective stands. In support of their versions, even the CDs containing Video of the incident have been filed by both the parties. We have seen the CD's filed by both the parties. However, on going through the CD submitted by the Respondent State, it becomes clear that the agitated protestors were the persons who were instrumental in triggering the incident inasmuch as it is they who took the first step in disturbing the peace. It is these agitators who started pelting stones on the police personnel and even used lathis while attacking the police officials. No doubt, these demonstrators wanted to go ahead with their march and they were restrained by the police from doing so. At the same time, this step taken by the police was at the instance of higher authorities and they were given orders that these demonstrators be not allowed to proceed with their march.

8. We can appreciate that holding peaceful demonstration in order to air their grievances and to see that their voice is heard in the relevant quarters is the right of the people. Such a right can be traced to the fundamental freedom that is guaranteed under Articles 19(1)(a), 19(1)(b) and 19(1)(c) of the Constitution. Article 19(1)(a) confers freedom of speech to the citizens of this country and, thus, this provision ensures that the Petitioners could raise slogan, albeit in a peaceful and orderly manner, without using offensive language. Article 19(1)(b) confers the right to assemble and, thus, guarantees that all citizens have the right to assemble peacefully and without arms. Right to move freely given Under Article 19(1)(d), again, ensures that the Petitioners could take out peaceful march. The 'right to assemble' is beautifully captured in an eloquent statement that ""an unarmed, peaceful protest procession in the land of 'salt satyagraha', fast-unto-death and 'do or die' is no jural anathema"". It hardly needs elaboration that a distinguishing feature of any democracy is the space offered for legitimate dissent. One cherished and valuable aspect of political life in India is a tradition to express grievances through direct action or peaceful protest. Organised, non-violent protest marches were a key weapon in the struggle for independence, and the right to peaceful protest is now recognised as a fundamental right in the Constitution.

9. Notwithstanding above, it is also to be borne in mind that the aforesaid rights are subject to reasonable restrictions in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India, as well as public order. It is for this reason, the State authorities many a times designate particular areas and routes, dedicating them for the purpose of holding public meetings.

10. On the other hand, there is always a possibility that a public rally may become unruly, which can mean damage to life and property. This is when a public assembly becomes 'unlawful', which is defined in Section 141 of the Indian Penal Code (Indian Penal Code). Under these circumstances, the district administration and the police are permitted to disperse the crowd to prevent injuries or damage. This may entail the use of force in a controlled and specified manner. We also have Section 268 of the Indian Penal Code which defines 'public nuisance' as any act 'which must necessarily cause injury, obstruction, danger or annoyance to persons who may have occasion to use any public right'. Further, Section 143 of the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers an Executive Magistrate to prohibit the repetition or continuation of public nuisances and Section 144 Code of Criminal Procedure permits the issuance of directions to members of the public to abstain from a certain act or to take certain order with respect to certain property in his possession or under his management, if such Magistrate considers that such direction is likely to prevent, or tends to prevent, obstruction, annoyance or injury to any person lawfully employed, or danger to human life, health or safety, or a disturbance of the public tranquility, or a riot, or an affray. These legal provisions provided a wide array of powers to the police, including the right to use reasonable force to disperse any unlawful assembly and maintain public order.

11. Thus, while on the one hand, citizens are guaranteed fundamental right of speech, right to assemble for the purpose of carrying peaceful protest processions and right of free movement, on the other hand, reasonable restrictions on such right can be put by law. Provisions of Indian Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure, discussed above, are in the form of statutory provisions giving powers to the State to ensure that such public assemblies, protests, dharnas or marches are peaceful and they do not become 'unlawful'. At the same time, while exercising such powers, the authorities are supposed to act within the limits of law and cannot indulge into excesses. How legal powers should be used to disperse an unruly crowd has been succinctly put by the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Karam Singh v. Hardayal Singh MANU/PH/0267/1979MANU/PH/0267/1979 : 1979 Crl. L.J. 1211 wherein the High Court held that three prerequisites must be satisfied before a Magistrate can order use of force to disperse a crowd:

First, there should be an unlawful assembly with the object of committing violence or an assembly of five or more persons likely to cause a disturbance of the public peace.

Second, an Executive Magistrate should order the assembly to disperse.

Third, in spite of such orders, the people do not move away.

12. Before adverting to the issue at hand, we would like to make some general remarks about the manner in which these demonstrations are taking shape. Recent happenings show an unfortunate trend where such demonstrations and protests are on increase. There are all kinds of protests: on social issues, on political issues and on demands of various Sections of the society of varied kinds. It is also becoming a common ground that religious, ethnic, regional language, caste and class divisions are frequently exploited to foment violence whenever mass demonstrations or dharnas etc take place. It is unfortunate that more often than not, such protestors take to hooliganism, vandalism and even destroy public/private property. In the process, when police tries to control, the protestors/mob violently target policemen as well. Unruly groups and violent demonstrations are so common that people have become to see them as an appendage of Indian democracy. All these situations frequently result in police using force. This in turn exacerbates public anger against the police. In Kashmir itself there have been numerous instances where separatist groups have provoked violence. In this scenario, task of the police and law enforcing agencies becomes more difficult and delicate. In curbing such violence or dispersing unlawful assemblies, police has to accomplish its task with utmost care, deftness and precision. Thus, on the one hand, law and order needs to be restored and at the same time, it is also to be ensured that unnecessary force or the force beyond what is absolutely essential is not used. Policemen are required to undergo special training to deal with these situations. Many times the situations turn ugly or go out of control because of lack of sufficient training to the police personnel to deal with violence and challenges to their authority. There are various documents in the form of police manual and even international covenants proscribing use of unnecessary force and mandating that force should only be used when it is absolutely necessary1. Even when used, it should be minimum and proportional to the situation and its use to be discontinued as soon as the danger to life and property subsidised.

13. In those cases where assembly is peaceful, use of police force is not warranted at all. However, in those situations where crowd or assembly becomes violent it may necessitate and justify using reasonable police force. However, it becomes a more serious problem when taking recourse to such an action, police indulges in excesses and crosses the limit by using excessive force thereby becoming barbaric or by not halting even after controlling the situation and continuing its tirade. This results in violation of human rights and human dignity. That is the reason that human rights activists feel that police frequently abuses its power to use force and that becomes a serious threat to the Rule of law.

14. When we examine the present matter in the aforesaid conspectus, we find that initially it was the Petitioners/protestors who took the law into their hands by turning their peaceful agitation into a violent one and in the process becoming unruly and petting stones at the police. On the other hand, even the police personnel continued the use of force beyond limits after they had controlled the mob. In the process, they continued their lathi charge. They continued to beat up all the three Petitioners even after overpowering them. They had virtually apprehended these Petitioners making them immobile. However, their attack on these Petitioners continued even thereafter when it was not at all needed. As far as injuries suffered by these Petitioners are concerned, such a situation could clearly be avoided. It is apparent that to that extent, Respondents misused their power. To that extent, fundamental right of the Petitioners, due to police excess, has been violated. In such circumstances, in exercise of its power Under Article 32 of the Constitution, this Court can award compensation to the Petitioners {See-Saheli, A Women's Resources Center, Through Ms. Nalini Bhanot and Ors. v. Commissioner of Police, Delhi Police Headquarters and Ors. MANU/SC/0478/1989MANU/SC/0478/1989 : (1990) 1 SCC 422; Joginder Kaur v. The Punjab State and Ors. MANU/PH/0265/1968MANU/PH/0265/1968 : (1969) ACJ 28; The State of Rajasthan v. Mst. Vidhywati and Anr. MANU/SC/0025/1962MANU/SC/0025/1962 : (1962) Supp 2 SCR 989; and Smt. Nilabati Behera @ Lalita Behera (through the Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee) v. State of Orissa and Ors. MANU/SC/0307/1993MANU/SC/0307/1993 : (1993) 2 SCC 746}. The ratio of these precedents can be explained thus: First, it is clear that a violation of fundamental rights due to police misconduct can give rise to a liability under public law, apart from criminal and tort law. Secondly, that pecuniary compensation can be awarded for such a violation of fundamental rights. Thirdly, it is the State that is held liable and, therefore, the compensation is borne by the State and not the individual police officers found guilty of misconduct. Fourthly, this Court has held that the standard of proof required for proving police misconduct such as brutality, torture and custodial violence and for holding the State accountable for the same, is high. It is only for patent and incontrovertible violation of fundamental rights that such remedy can be made available. Fifthly, the doctrine of sovereign immunity does not apply to cases of fundamental rights violation and hence cannot be used as a defence in public law.

15. Keeping in view the totality of the circumstances of the present case and finding that even the Petitioners are to be blamed to some extent, as pointed out above, the only relief we grant is to award compensation of ` 2,00,000 (rupees two lakhs only) to Petitioner No. 1 and ` 1,00,000 (rupees one lakh only) each to Petitioner Nos. 2 and 3, which shall be paid to these Petitioners within a period of two months.

16. The writ petition stands disposed of in the aforesaid terms.

1 These documents, inter alia, are:

(a) Model Rules on the Use of Force by the Police against unlawful Crowds (Adopted by the Inspectors General of Police Conference, 1964).

(b) Police Manuals: For instance, the Kerala Police Manual, 1970 lays down a step-by-step procedure to deal with unlawful assemblies:

 The police must invariably secure the presence of a magistrate where it anticipates a breach of peace

 The decision to use force and the type of force to be used is to be taken by the magistrate

 Once the order for the use of force is given by the magistrate, the extent of force to be used will be determined by the senior-most police officer

 The extent of force used must be subject to the principle of minimum use of force

 Use of force should be progressive-i.e. firearms must be used as a last resort if tear smoke and lathi charge fail to disperse the crowd

 Common tear-smoke which causes no bodily injury and allows recovery of affected persons should be used

 When the crowd is large and the use of tear-smoke is likely to serve no useful purpose, the police may resort to lathi charge

 Lathi charge can only begin if the crowd refuses to disperse after suitable warning

 Clear warning of the intention to carry out a lathi charge should be given through a bugle or whistle call in a language understood by the crowd. If available, a riot flag must be raised. If the police officer in-charge is satisfied it is not practical to give a warning, s/he may order a lathi charge without warning.

 Lathi blows should be aimed at soft portions of the body and contact with the head or collarbone should be avoided as far as practicable

 The lathi blows must not cease until the crowd is completely dispersed

 If the crowd fails to disperse through the lathi charge, the magistrate or the competent officer8 may order firing

 The fullest warning in a clear and distinct manner must be given to the crowd to inform them that the firing will be effective

 If after the warning, the crowd refuses to disperse the order to fire may be given

 The police are not on any account allowed to fire except on a command given by their officer

 A warning shot in the air or firing over the heads of the crowd is not permitted

 An armed force should maintain a safe distance from a dangerous crowd to prevent being overwhelmed, or increasing the chances of inflicting heavy casualties

 Aim should be kept low and directed at the most threatening part of the crowd

 Firing should cease the moment the crowd show signs of dispersing

 All help should be rendered to convey the wounded to the hospital

 Police officers must not leave the scene of disturbance before satisfying themselves beyond reasonable doubt about the restoration of tranquility

 An accurate diary of all incidents, orders and action along with the time of occurrence should be maintained by the police. This will include an individual report by all officers involved in the firing.

 The number of fired cartridges and the balance of unfired cartridges should be verified to ensure ammunition is accounted for

1. The assessees claimed the benefit of an exemption notification. The revenue challenged the claim. The matters went higher and upto the customs, excise and gold (control) appellate tribunal, which decided in favour of the assessees. In the interregnum, the assessees paid the excise duty under protest. Upon the appeals before the tribunal being decided in their favour, on 17th January, 1991, the assessees claimed repayment of the amount of duty paid by them under protest.

Claim for refund of duty. - (1) Any person claiming refund of any duty of excise may make an application for refund of such duty to the assistant commissioner of central excise before the expiry of six months from the relevant date in such form and manner as may be prescribed and the application shall be accompanied by such documentary or other evidence including the documents referred to in Section 12A as the applicant may furnish to establish that the amount of duty of excise, in relation to which such refund is claimed was collected from, or paid by him and the incidence of such duty had not been passed on by him to any other person;

Provided that where an application for refund has been made before the commencement of the Central Excises and Customs Laws (Amendment) Act, 1991, such application shall be deemed to have been made under the sub-section as amended by the said Act and the same shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Sub-section (2) substituted by that Act:

Provided further that the limitation of six months shall not apply where any duty has been paid under protest.

(2) If, on receipt of any such application, the assistant commissioner of central excise is satisfied that the whole or any part of the duty of excise paid by the applicant is refundable, he may make an order accordingly and the amount so determined shall be credited to the fund:

Provided that the amount of duty of excise as determined by the assistant commissioner of central excise under the foregoing provisions of this sub-section shall, instead of being credited to the fund, be paid to the applicant, if such amount is relatable to -

(a) rebate of duty of excise on excisable goods exported out of India or on excisable materials used in the manufacture of goods which are exported out of India;

(b) unspent advance deposits lying in balance in the applicant's account current maintained with the commissioner of central excise;

(c) refund of credit of duty paid on excisable goods used as inputs in accordance with the rules made, or any notification issued, under this Act;

(d) the duty of excise paid by the manufacturer, if he had not passed on the incidence of such duty to any other person;

(e) the duty of excise borne by the buyer, if he had not passed on the incidence of such duty to any other person;

(f) the duty of excise borne by any other such class of applicants as the central government may, by notification in the official gazette specify;

Provided further that no notification under Clause (f) of the first proviso shall be issued unless in the opinion of the central government the incidence of duty has not been passed on by the persons concerned to any other person.

(3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any judgment, decree, order or direction of the appellate tribunal or any court or in any other provision of this Act or the rules made thereunder or any other law for the time being in force, no refund shall be made except as provided in Sub-section (2).

Explanation. - For the purposes of this section...

(B) 'relevant date' means -

(f) in any other case, the date of payment of duty.""

3. On 3rd July, 1993 the assessees were served with notices which asked them to show cause why the amounts of excise duty paid by them under protest should not be retained by the revenue, having regard to the provisions of Section 11-B as amended. The assessees showed cause, but to no avail. This matter also, ultimately, reached the tribunal and, by the order under challenge, the tribunal upheld the contention of the revenue.

4. Subsequent to this decision of the tribunal a bench of nine learned judges of this Court has resolved the issue in favour of the assessees. The judgment is in Mafatlal Industries Limited v. Union of India MANU/SC/1203/1997MANU/SC/1203/1997 : 1997(89)ELT247(SC) . The relevant paragraph is para (95), and it, so far as is relevant, reads thus:

""Rule 9B provides for provisional assessment in situations specified in Clauses (a), (b) and (c) of Sub-rule (1). The goods provisionally assessed under Sub-rule (1) may be cleared for home consumption or export in the same manner as the goods which are finally assessed. Sub-rule (5) provides that when the duty leviable on the goods is assessed finally in accordance with the provisions of these rules, the duty provisionally assessed shall be adjusted against the duty finally assessed, and if the duty provisionally assessed falls short of or in excess of the duty finally assessed, the assessee shall pay the deficiency or be entitled to a refund, as the case may be'. Any recoveries or refunds consequent upon the adjustment under Sub-rule (5) of Rule 9B will not be governed by Section 11A or Section 11B, as the case may be.""

5. It is fairly not disputed by learned counsel for the revenue that the decision in Mafatlal Industries Limited governs the appeals.

6. Accordingly, the appeals are allowed and the order under appeal is set aside. Consequential repayments shall be made within twelve weeks.

7. There shall be no order as to costs.

Brijesh Kumar, J.

1. The Central Board of Secondary Education (for short 'the Board'), felt aggrieved by the decision of Madhya Pradesh High Court rendered on 2.7.1996 in writ petition No. 426 of 1996, filed by the respondents No. 1 and 2, whereby directing the Board to declare the result of the examination undertaken by the respondent No. 1 for class X in the year 1996, hence the present appeal. In the impugned judgment it was also directed that a fresh marks-sheet be also issued to her, since the result had been declared earlier only provisionally. The grievance of the Board that the respondent No. 1 was not eligible to appear in the high school examination, was not accepted.

2. The brief facts of the case are that the respondent No. 1 was a student of St. Paul's School, Morar, Gwalior, affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education, New Delhi. She filled up form for high school examination but the same was withheld by the school authorities on the ground that she had not cleared her class IX examination. It gave rise to filing of a writ petition No. 484/95 by respondents Nos. 1 and 2, the candidate and her father. On 4.4.95 an interim order was passed by the High Court to the following effect :-

""4.4.95

ORDER

1) Notice of admission was given to the respondents.

2) There is a report that respondents have refused the notice.

3) Let a fresh notice be sent by way of registered post also and service be effected by affixation. The Notices be issued for 18th April, 1995.

4) In para 11 of the Petition, it has been stated that the Petitioner was initially ""promoted"" but later on she was declared to have ""failed"". In this view of the matter, a direction is given to the respondents to permit the petitioner No. 2 to join Class X. This would be subject to the decision of this petition.

C.C. Today.

Later yet another interim order was granted on 19,9.1995 in Writ Petition No. 484 of 1995 to the following effect:-

""19.9.1995

ORDER

Petitioner No. 2 be permitted to take part in the examination.

To come up on the date already fixed.

Sd/- T.S. Doabia

Judge""

The Writ Petition No. 484/95 was thereafter disposed of by order dated 5.12.95, which reads as under:-

""Heard.

This petition is rendered infructuous as the admission form for appearing in examination of the petitioner has since been sent to the Central Board of Secondary Education, Delhi. This is class X examination. As per the respondents the Petitioner would be permitted to take part in this examination. No further direction is required.

Disposed of as such.

Sd/-

Judge""

3. It, however, appears that another writ petition No. 426 of 1996 was filed by respondents No. 1 and 2 with a prayer that a telegram sent by the Regional Officer of the Board, Ajmer, Rajasthan not permitting her to appear in the examination may be quashed and the petitioner No. 1 may be allowed to appear in the examination of the Board which was to start on 6.3.1996. On 1.3.1996 the High Court passed the following interim order:-

""....In view of these circumstances, it is directed that petitioner should be permitted to appear in the examination at the roll No. III 8864 as mentioned in the telegram, in all papers of Class Xth. The result, however, would be subject to the decision of this petition, Certified copy today, on payment.

Judge""

4. Thereafter the next order was passed on 17.5.1996 saying ""....Let the result of the petitioner be declared. List in the last week of June, 1996"". Ultimately, the petition was finally disposed of by order dated 2.7.1996. The High Court in its judgment refers to the plea raised by the appellant to the effect that for taking up examination for Class X a student must complete a regular course of studies for Class IX from an institution affiliated to the Board. Since the respondent No. 1 had not passed her class IX examination she was not eligible for appearing in the examination in Class X. Thereafter bye-law 10.2 was quoted in the judgment, which provision, according to the High Court, was very material. It is as follows:-

""10.2 A candidate for All India/Delhi Secondary School Examination ..should have:-

(a) passed the Middle School Examination (Class VIII) of a Board or of an affiliated/recognized school at least two years earlier than the year in which he would take secondary school (Class X) examination;

(b) secured a grade higher than grade E in each of the subject of internal assessment at the Examination referred to at (a) above; and

(c) passed the third language as per requirement laid down in the scheme of studies.""

On the basis of the above provision, the Court found that the respondent No. 1 possessed minimum educational qualification of middle school examination (Class VIII) so as to be entitled for appearing in the class X examination. Hence direction was issued to finally declare the result of respondent No. 1 and to issue a fresh marks-sheet. Learned counsel for the appellant has, however, drawn our attention to provision contained in bye-law 7.3 of the bye-laws of the Board which reads as under-

""7.3. Admission to Class X in a school shall be open only to such a student who:-

(a) has completed a regular course of studies for class IX, and;

(b) has passed class IX examination from an institution affiliated to this Board or to any recognized board or to any recognized board or is recognized by the Education Department of the govt. or the State/U.T. in which such an institution is located.

x x x

Thereafter bye-law No. 16 is referred, relating to private candidates. It is as follows:-

""16. Private Candidates

Definition: For the purposes of the bye-laws contained in this chapter and the chapter 5, unless there is something repugnant in the subject or context a Private Candidate' means a person who is not a Regular Candidate but, under the provisions of the bye-laws, is allowed to undertake and/or appear in the All India/Delhi Senior School Certificate Examination or All India/Delhi Secondary School Examination of the Board.

x x x

We find that bye-laws Nos. 21 and 22 are also relevant which are quoted below:-

""21. Person eligible to appear as a Private Candidate for All India Secondary School Examination: -

(i) A candidate who had failed at the All India Secondary School Examination of the Board, will be eligible to reappear at the subsequent examination as a Private candidate in the syllabus and text books as prescribed for the examination of the year in which he will reappear.

(ii) Teachers serving in institutions affiliated to the Board.

x x x

22 (v) Those regular Candidates who have failed to obtain promotion to class X of the school affiliated to the . Board or any other recognized Board shall not be admitted to the Delhi Secondary Examination of the Board as private candidates.""

The definite case taken on behalf of the appellant before the High Court has been that the respondent No. 1 had failed in her class IX examination for the year 1994-95. In this context the prayer made by the respondent No. 1 in her writ petition No. 484 of 1995, may be referred to, which reads as follows :

""(i) to quash the result declared by the Respondent No. 3 in so far as respondent No. 1 is concerned and Respondent No. 1 be declared as promoted;

(ii) Respondent No. 3 be directed to take supplementary examination in Hindi and English subjects within a period of seven days with a further direction to the respondent No. 3 to give respondent No. 1 some time to prepare herself for the supplementary examination.""

It is thus clear that, according to the respondent No. 1 herself she was declared failed in her examination for class IX. The High Court, while finally deciding the writ petition No. 426 of 1996 by order dated 2.7.1996 conveniently overlooked to take note of the provision contained in bye-law No. 7.3, contents of which have been indicated above. There was only a mention of Clause 7.3 of bye-laws of the Board but nothing beyond that was indicated or observed in the judgment, as to why it would not be applicable to the case. After quoting bye-law 10.2 the High Court held that the respondent No. 1 was eligible to appear in the high-school examination since there was a gap of two years in between her two examinations viz. class VIII and class X. The High Court also did not record any finding in respect of other conditions as mentioned in bye-law No. 10.2, namely, a student must have secured higher than 'E' grade in each subject of internal assessment and has also passed the third language as per requirement laid down in the scheme. The High Court failed to consider that bye-law 10.2 will not be applicable to the respondent No. 1 but it would be bye-law 7.3, which would apply in her case. Therefore, it was necessary that she must have passed class IX as a regular student before she could be allowed to undertake examination for class X held by the Board. The position stands further clarified in regard to the private candidates under bye-laws No. 16 and 21. The respondent No. 1 did not fulfill the conditions laid for private candidates and her case would only be covered by bye-law 7.3 and not by bye-law No. 10.2 of the examination bye-laws of the Board as held by the High Court. Despite the position under the bye-laws as indicated above, the High Court finally disposed of the writ petition no. 426 of 1996 cursorily holding that since the respondent No. 1 had appeared in the examination and her result had been declared provisionally therefore, the Board was directed to declare her result of class X and to issue a fresh marks sheet without any endorsement thereon (emphasis supplied). It was completely overlooked that by order dated 1.3.1996, it was provided that the respondent No. 1 was allowed to appear in examination, subject to the decision of the writ petition. Hence there was no occasion to say that since provisional result has been declared therefore, final result should also be declared with a fresh marks sheet without any endorsement thereon. The validity of the examination undertaken by respondent No. 1 should have been properly scrutinized in the light of all the relevant examination bye-laws of the Board.

5. We also find that in writ petition No. 484 of 1995, interim orders were granted permitting the filling up of the form for high-school examination. But while ultimately disposing of the petition, it was held that the writ petition had become infructuous since the examination form of the respondent No. 1 had been forwarded to the Central Board of Secondary Education, Delhi and it is attributed to the respondents in the petition, that ""as per the respondents"", the candidate would be permitted to take part in the examination. It was, therefore, thought that no further direction was required and the matter was disposed of as infructuous. Merely forwarding of an examination form by an institution affiliated to the examining body is no surety that the examining body would necessarily permit the candidate to undertake the examination. The forms after being sent are scrutinized and checked by the examining body.

6. This Court has on several occasions earlier deprecated the practice of permitting the students to pursue their studies and to appear in the examination under the interim orders passed in the petitions. In most of such cases it is ultimately pleaded that since the course was over or the result has been declared, the matter deserves to be considered sympathetically. It results into very awkward and difficult situations. Rules stare straight into the face of the plea of sympathy and concessions, against the legal provisions. A few decisions on the point may be perused. In C.B.S.E. and Anr. v. P. Sunil Kumar and Ors. , MANU/SC/1047/1998MANU/SC/1047/1998 : [1998]3SCR327 , the institutions whose students were permitted to undertake the examination of the Central Board of Secondary Education were not affiliated to the Board, hence the students were not entitled to appear in the examination. They were, however, allowed to appear in the examination under the interim orders granted by the Court in contravention of the rules and regulations of the Board. The High Court considering the matter sympathetically had not interfered, but this Court observed thus :

""....But to permit students of an unaffiliated institution to appear at the examination conducted by the Board under orders of the Court and then to compel the Board to issue certificates in favour of those who have undertaken examination would tantamount to subversion of law and this Court will not be justified to sustain the orders issued by the High Court on misplaced sympathy in favour of the students....""

The order of the High Court was set aside. Another decision reported in MANU/SC/0364/1993MANU/SC/0364/1993 : AIR1993SC2412 , Guru Nanak Dev University v. Parminder Kr. Bansal, a three judge bench decision, was relied upon in the case of Sunil Kumar (supra) . A passage from the above noted decision was also quoted therein which reads as follows :

""We are afraid that this kind of administration of interlocutory remedies, more guided by sympathy quite often wholly misplaced, does no service to anyone. From the series of orders that keep coming before us in academic matters, we find that loose, ill-conceived sympathy masquerades as interlocutory justice exposing judicial discretion to the criticism of degenerating into private benevolence. This is subversive of academic discipline, or whatever is left of it, leading to serious impasse in academic life. Admissions cannot be ordered without regard to the eligibility of the candidates. Decisions on matters relevant to be taken into account at the interlocutory stage cannot be deferred or decided later when serious complications might ensue from the interim order itself. In the present case, the High Court was apparently moved by sympathy for the candidates than by an accurate assessment of even the prima facie legal position. Such orders cannot be allowed to stand. The courts should not embarrass academic authorities by themselves taking over their functions.""

Yet another decision referred to is reported in MANU/SC/0046/1986MANU/SC/0046/1986 : [1986]2SCR749 , A.P.Christians Medical Educational Society v. Government of Andhra Pradesh and Anr.etc. etc. , again a three judge bench decision. It was observed in this case :

""....We cannot by our fiat direct the University to disobey the statute to which it owes its existence and the regulations made by the University itself. We cannot imagine anything more destructive of the rule of law than a direction by the court to disobey the laws.""

The above referred matter relates to the admission and examination of M.B.B.S. courses.

7. In the background of the law as laid down by this Court, we find that in the case in hand the fact situation was even worse as compared to the decision cited above. The student, namely, respondent No. 1 had failed to clear her class IX examination which was a necessary requirement as provided under the bye-laws of the Board so as to be entitled to appear in the class X examination conducted by the Board. Despite notice, no one has put in appearance on behalf of the respondents No. 1 and 2 to indicate any fact or circumstance so as to take any different view. Condoning the lapses or overlooking the legal requirements in consideration of mere sympathy factor does not solve the problem rather breeds more violations in the hope of being condoned. It disturbs the discipline of the system and ultimately adversely affects the academic standards.

8. In the result, we allow the appeal and set aside the judgment and order dated 2.7.1996 passed by the High Court in writ petition No. 426 of 1996. There would, however, be no order as to costs.

S.B. Sinha, J.

1. The appellants herein are successors in interest of late Chogyal Sir Tashi Namgyal of Sikkim.

2. A suit was filed by Mewang Tobyal Wanghuck Tenzing Namgyal son of late Chogyal Palden Thondup Namgyal and Others against the defendants-respondents herein praying for the following reliefs:

(a) recovery of possession of the encroached portion of the land shown in the annexed plan if required, by demolishing the construction made thereon:

(b) permanent injunction restraining the defendants from using the aforesaid 12 feet wide passage or making any construction whatsoever over the same;

(c) pending disposal of the suit an order for restraining the defendants from construction of the flyover or blocking the passage and also restraining the defendants from carrying on with further work of construction on the encroached land shown in the attached plan;

(d) cost of the suit;

(e) any other relief or reliefs to which the plaintiff may be found entitled to under the law and equity.

3. Shortly stated, the said suit was filed on the following allegation:

Plot Nos. 1013, 1014 and 1040 (part) situated at Gangtok belonged to late Chogyal Sir Tashi Namgyal of Sikkim were his personal properties forming part of his private estate which upon his death devolved or the original plaintiff and on his death upon the appellants. Allegedly, one pucca building was constructed on Plot No. 1014 situated at New Market Road, Gangtok which was let out to the tenants. On the adjacent land to the same building, there existed a private passage of 12 feet width made of steps and further on the adjacent south thereto, there was another building known as Yuthok, building situated on Plot No. 1012. Another passage existed behind the aforesaid two buildings which is said to be a private gully being Plot No. 1013. There are two wooden buildings used as kitchen, latrines and godown for the use of tenants occupying Nayabazar building and Yuthok building.

4. Allegedly there was a retaining wall on the west of Plot No. 1040 (part) which was the boundary between the land of the Plaintiffs' private estate and the land of defendant No.2.

5. According to the plaintiffs, the defendants started construction of a big pucca building for the purpose of running a hotel on the land situated on the south of his land being Plot No. 1040 and allegedly the defendants illegally encroached upon about 6,600 sq. ft. therein.

6. The defendants filed their written statement denying and disputing the allegations made in the plaint. The defendants although admitted the existence of the pucca building and the flight of steps but contended that the latter belonged to Gangtok Municipality which was meant to serve as the exclusive passage to the plot on which defendant No.2 had been constructing a multi-storeyed building. It was alleged that beyond the structures of the plaintiffs a precipitated hill edge exists on the eastern boundary of the defendants land and the same was all through in their exclusive possession. The defendants claimed settlement of their land by reason of three documents which were marked as Exhibits D-9, D-10 and D-11 of the years 1961, 1975 and 1977 respectively.

7. The said suit was initially dismissed by the District Judge, Gangtok by a judgment and decree dated 29th March, 1985 whereagainst the plaintiffs preferred an appeal before the High Court. By a judgment dated 11.8.1986 while setting aside the judgment and decree of the learned District Judge the matter was remanded with a direction to appoint another Commissioner to make local investigation with reference to the cloth survey map and on actual measurement on the spot so as to ascertain the actual area of Plot No. 1040, the area covered by the Denzong Cinema, the Tashik Delek Hotel and the exact location of all other constructions in a map. An opportunity was also given to the parties to re-examine their witnesses to clear the anomalies indicated in the said judgment.

8. Pursuant to or in furtherance of the said direction contained in the said judgment, the learned District Jude appointed another Commissioner who inter alia, found that Plot No. 1040 measures 0.69 acres out of which the land allotted to the defendants was 13,879 sq. ft. and the total area of construction made by defendant Nos. 1 and 2 being the Denzong Cinema, two shop houses and hotel comes to 13,616.46 sq. ft., which was accepted by the defendants but according to the plaintiffs the same was 13,503.60 sq.ft.

9. The learned District Judge, Gangtok by a judgment and decree dated 26.2.1988 decreed the suit. A Division Bench of the High Court, however, in appeal reversed the said judgment and decree by a judgment dated 30th June, 1994.

10. The appellants are before us in appeal questioning the correctness or otherwise of the said judgment.

11. Mr. G.L. Sanghi, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants, inter alia, submitted that the High Court committed a serious error in construing the Khasra (Exhibit P-36) in so far as it held the entries appearing in the name of Sir Tashil Namgyal did not belong to his private estate. The learned counsel would contend that the High Court further fell in error in holding that his Plot. No. 1040 being situated within the bazar area was acquired for a sum of Rs. 1,50,000/-. It was submitted that as there had been no transfer of title from the plaintiffs to the private estate in any manner whatsoever, the Government of Sikkim did not derive any title thereto.

12. Mr. Sanghi would contend that the purported acquisition of the suit land said to have been proved by Exhibits D-7, D-14 and D-23/12 does not show that there had been any transfer of property within the meaning of Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act which was applicable to the State of Sikkim and in absence thereof the ownership of the plaintiffs in respect of Plot Nos. 1013 and 1040 continued with the plaintiffs. Drawing our attention to certain findings of the High Court in Civil Appeal No. 2 of 1985, the learned counsel would argue that the High Court in its judgment arrived at an erroneous conclusion that a 'private estate' had not been mentioned against the Plot Nos. 1013 and 1040 in Exhibit P-36, the same had vested in the State of Sikkim.

13. Mr. Mitra, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of respondent No.1, on the other hand, would submit that the conspectus of events found by the High Court in the judgment under appeal would clearly establish that the defendants have constructed the hotel building in accordance with the sanction accorded by the competent authorities. It was submitted that most of the documents, whereupon reliance had been placed by the High Court were produced by the plaintiffs and/or received from the custody of their witnesses. Mr. Mitra would contend that having regard to the facts and circumstances of this case no presumption can be raised as regards correctness of the entries made in Khasra (Exhibit P-36). In support of the said contention, strong reliance has been placed on Sita Ram Bhau Patil v. Ramchandra Nago Patil (Dead) By L.Rs. and Anr. MANU/SC/0285/1977MANU/SC/0285/1977 : [1977]2SCR671 .

14. Mr. Bhaskar Gupta, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of respondent No.2 would submit that as in the instant case, the plaintiffs have not been able to prove their title over Plot No. 1040, an independent investigation thereof with reference to the defendants' title was not necessary. The learned counsel in support of the said contention placed strong reliance on Nagar Palika. Jind v. Jagat Singh, Advocate MANU/SC/0260/1995MANU/SC/0260/1995 : [1995]3SCR9 .

15. The Plaintiff's predecessor in interest was late Chogyal Sir Tashi Namgyal of Sikkim. There is, therefore, no question of plaintiff's having any document of title.

16. The only document of title which was produced by the plaintiff sin support of their claim is the aforementioned Khasra (Exhibit P-36). In Exhibit P-36 entries against different plots, inter alia, have been made in the name of 'Sarkar' as also in the name of 'Shri Panch Maharaja Sir Tashi Namgyal of Sikkim'. Certain plots have also been recorded as 'Private Estate. Plot No. 1013 has been recorded in the name of Shri Panch Maharaj Sir Tashi Namgyal. Plot Nos. 1041 and 1040 have also been recorded in his name. In none of the entries the area of the plots is mentioned. It is relevant to note that the plaintiffs in their plaint claimed ownership in respect of Plot. Nos. 1013, 1014 and 1040 (part). No claim had been made in the plaint that the entire plot No. 1040 belonged to the plaintiffs.

17. How the plaintiffs claimed title in respect of a part of Plot No. 1040 has also not been disclosed. The said Khasra was prepared in the year 1954. However, admittedly a suggestion to acquire the said land was mooted to the effect that a lump-sum payment may be made to the 'private estate' in lieu of the bazar area with all the income accruing therefrom upon payment of a sum of Rs. 1,50,000/- to the private estate, so that the same may vest in the Sikkim Darbar.

18. The said proposal was put up for approval and sanction of the Chogyal. On 22nd June, 1959, the said proposal was accepted. Requisite steps for payment of the said amount to the private estate were taken on 26th June, 1959. Exhibit D-7 contains an entry in the cash book of the Finance Department of Sikkim regarding payment of Rs. 1,50,000/-. Exhibit D-8 is a classified abstract showing the expenditure of the Government of Sikkim for the year 1959-60 regarding payment of Rs. 1,50,000/-. Both Exhibits D-7 and D-8 are dated 07.12.1959.

19. The High Court recorded a finding to the effect that all lands which were entered in the Khasra (Exhibit P-36) in the name of Sir Tashil Namgyal did not belong to this private estate. The said finding, however, may not be correct in view of the fact that admittedly his lands in suit were subject matter of acquisition.

20. We therefore, may proceed on the assumption that the said finding of the High Court is incorrect.

21. The question which, therefore, ought to have been raised was not that as to how the said property was treated prior to 24.6.1959 but how the said property has been treated thereafter. It is not in dispute that the Sikkim Darbar granted settlement of piece and parcel of land measuring (166' x 66' -2472 x 16') in favour of the first respondent for construction of Cinema Hall on 10-4-1961. Several letters appear to have been passed between the Executive Officer, Bazar Department of Government of Sikkim and the respondents herein with regard to the constructions on the said land. Admittedly the original plaintiff held share sin Denzong Cinema Limited. it is also beyond any dispute that construction of the Cinema Hall started in the year 1969. The State of Sikkim merged with the Union of India in terms of an agreement on 26th April, 1975.

22. Article 371F(h) of the Constitution of India reads thus:

""371 F. Special provisions with respect to the State of Sikkim.--Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution,-

(h) all property and assets (whether within or outside the territories comprised the State of Sikkim) which immediately before the appointed day were vested in the Government of Sikkim or in any other authority or in any person for the purposes of the Government of Sikkim shall, as from the appointed day, vest in the Government of the State of Sikkim.""

23. After merger of Sikkim in the Union of India, the proposal to construct a hotel started. The records of the case clearly demonstrate that for the purpose of construction of hotel the defendants not only sought for but also were granted additional lands. They took permission for construction of the hotel from the appropriate authorities.

24. In this connection, it will be relevant to notice the following important documents:-

1. 24-6-76 to 22-7-76:

Ex. P-24, P-25 and P-26 are extracts taken out : from N.S.

25. The High Court discussed the evidence brought on records by the parties in great details. On cogent and sufficient reasons it did not accept the statements of the witnesses examined on behalf of the plaintiffs. Relying on or on the basis of various documents, it came to the conclusion that even if the private estate said to be belonging to late Chogyal had any interest in Plot Nos. 1010 and 1013, the same was acquired by the Government and, thus, ceased to be the private estate on and from 1959. The High Court further took into consideration various documents as to how the Government had treated Plot No. 1040 as belonging to it and not to the 'estate', both before and after merger of Sikkim with Government of India. It, as noticed hereinbefore, further held that the constructions raised by the defendants were within the land settled in favour of the respondents by Exhibits D-9, D- 10 and D-11.

26. The High Court in its judgment also took into consideration the report of the Second Advocate Commissioner and relied thereupon.

27. The plaintiffs claimed title over the suit land on the basis of their title thereupon and not on previous possession. Their case, thus, must stand or fall on their own pleadings. As indicated hereinbefore, the plaintiffs proceeded on the basis that they were owners of a part of Plot NO. 1040. They did not specify the extent thereof. They did not say how and to what extent a part of Plot No. 1040 belonged to them. They did not question the settlements made by the Sikkim Darbar in favour of the respondents and various other persons. In fact, the plaintiff's predecessor held shares in the defendant No.2 company. In the facts and circumstances of the case it was obligatory on the part of the plaintiffs to prove that the lands allegedly encroached upon by the defendants belonged to them. Plaintiffs have miserably failed to prove the same. Furthermore, indisputably the bazar area had been acquired by the Sikkim Darbar. Mr. N.K. Rustomji, who was Diwan of Sikkim at the relevant time, examined himself as witness No. 6 for the Plaintiffs. He in no uncertain terms stated:

""I understand the meaning of 'acquisition'. The heading of the file as given on page of the note is ""Acquisition of private estate land for Gangtok Bazar and payment of lumpsum compensation Rs. 1,50,000/- to the Private Estate"".

28. The other documents referred to hereinbefore, namely, Exhibits D-7, D-14, and D-23 to D-23/12 are also clear pointers to the fact that certain properties over which late Chogyal of Sikkim had been claiming right as its private estate were acquired by the Sikkim Darbar of which he was the head. The owner of the land accepted the amount of compensation without any demur whatsoever and in that view of the matter he as well as his successors in interest are estopped and precluded from contending that the said properties did not vest in the Sikkim Darbar and consequently in the Government of India.

29. The submission of Mr. Sanghi to the effect that the plaintiffs continued to have title in respect of the lands in question despite acquisition thereof must, therefore, be rejected.

30. It is not (SIC) dispute that Sikkim prior to its merger with the Union of India was a sovereign State. Chogyal was the owner of the entire properties. Evidently the lands were recorded in different names. If Chogyal of Sikkim exercised his right of 'Eminent Domain' in relation to the suit properties which were said to be belonging to his private estate, no registered deed of sale was required to be executed in his favour.

31. In any event, once the said lands are held to have vested in the Sikkim Darbar, the same consequently vested in the Government of Sikkim for the purpose of the Government.

32. The khasra and khatian have not been prepared under a statute. The question as to whether the same would be historical material or instrument of title or otherwise, would depend upon either the statute governing the same or the practice prevailing in the State. In the event, however, the records of right were not prepared under a statute, a presumption of correctness may be raised only in terms of Section 35 of the Indian Evidence Act.

33. However, ordinarily records of right cannot be treated to have any evidentiary value on the question of title inasmuch as such records are prepared mainly based on possession.

34. The entries in the Khasra (Exhibit P-36) must, therefore be construed keeping the aforementioned principles of law in view.

35. In Sita Ram Bhau Patil (supra), this Court held:

""With regard to the record of rights Counsel for the appellant said that presumption arises with regards to its correctness. There is no abstract principle that whatever will appear in the record of rights will be presumed to be correct when it is shown by evidence that the entries are not correct. Apart from the intrinsic evidence in the record of rights that they refer to facts which are untrue it also appears that the record of rights have reference to the mutation entry that was made by the Circle Officer on January 30, 1956. Counsel for the respondent rightly contended that no presumption could arise for two principal reasons. First, the oral evidence in this case nullified the entries in the record of rights as showing a state of affairs opposed to the real state of affairs and, second, no notice was ever given to the respondent with regard to mutation proceedings. Therefore the respondent is right in contending that no presumption can validly arise from the record of rights.""

36. Having regard to the fact that the plaintiffs never claimed any right over the entire Plot No. 1040 and further having regard to the fact that only a toilet was said to have existed thereupon, as also having regard to the subsequent events which took place, namely, acquisition of land, we are of the opinion that the entry in Exhibit P-36 is not of much value for the purpose of showing that the plaintiffs continued to have title over the said property.

37. Furthermore, the plaintiffs claimed title over the suit land. The trial Court in a case of this nature was bound to enquire or investigate into the question of title and could not have decreed the suit merely on the basis of the entries in the revenue records [See Nagar Paliak v. Jagar Singh (supra)].

38. For the reasons aforementioned, we are of the opinion that no case has been made out for our interference with the judgment and decree under appeal. This appeal is, therefore, dismissed but in the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs.

G.B. Pattanaik, J.

1. These Interlocutory Applications and Contempt Petitions are all off shoots of the Judgment of this Court dated 31.1.2001 in Civil Appeal No. 2218 of 1999 and the subsequent circular issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs (Banking Division) in implementation of the directions of this Court. According to the applicants, the circular issued by the Government of India in the Ministry of Finance (Banking Division), purported to be one in compliance with the directions of the Court in Judgment dated 31.1.2001 in effect, is contrary to the Judgment of the Court and is a willful disrespect to and in deliberate violation of the judgment and directions of the Court and as such, must be held to be grossly contemptuous and the contemnors should be duly punished for the same.

2. The main controversy in the Civil Appeal was, whether on acceptance of any bipartite settlement between the management and the employees of the sponsor bank, the employees and officers of the Regional Rural Banks ipso facto would be entitled to the revision of their wages? While the management and the Union of India vehemently contended that there cannot be an ipso facto revision of wages of the employees of the Regional Rural Banks as and when a settlement is arrived at between the management and employees of the sponsor bank and the appropriate authority of the Central Government would be required to exercise power under Section 17 of the Regional Rural Banks Act, 1976, the employees on the other hand, strongly relied upon the Report of Justice Obul Reddi Tribunal and submitted that in view of the conclusion of the tribunal that parity should be maintained between the employees of the Regional Rural Banks as well as the employee of the sponsor nationalised commercial banks, the so-called decision making power under Section 17(1) of the Act, is in fact a formal and clerical one. Ultimately, this Court accepted the contention of the Union Government as well as the Management of the Bank and came to hold that it would be the power of the Central Government to decide the pay structure of the employees of the Regional Rural Banks under Section 17(1) of the Act and in so doing, the Government would be duty bound to maintain parity between the pay structure of the employees of the nationalised commercial banks and the employees of the Regional Rural Banks in the same sense and spirit as Justice Obul Reddi had decided. This Court ultimately issued this further direction as under:

""In view of the aforesaid conclusions of ours on the different contentions raised and in view of the fact that the Union of India in its Interlocutory Application had already indicated that the employees of the RRBs will be granted the new scales w.e.f. 1.4.2000 in the line with scales granted to commercial bank employees of equivalent level, we direct that the said determination be a determination under the second proviso to Sub-section (1) of Section 17 of the RRB Act and as such the salary of the employees of the Regional Rural Banks w.e.f. 1.4.2000 be determined accordingly.

We also further direct that for maintaining the parity between the employees of the commercial banks and the employees of the Regional Rural Banks, the said Union Government shall decide the question as to what would be the salary of the employees of the RRBs subsequent to the 6th Bipartite Settlement having been given effect to, in case of employees of the commercial banks and with effect from what date and the benefit flowing from such decision be given to the RRB employees. The decision in question shall be taken within a period of six months from today.""

3. It may be stated that the Union of India had filed an interlocutory application, wherein in the larger interest of the employees and depositors of the Regional Rural Banks, it had proposed to give a package, but that package however had not been accepted by the employees of the Regional Rural Banks and, therefore, the Court ultimately heard the matter and delivered the judgment. In implementation of the directions of the Court as aforesaid, the Government of India, Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs (Banking Division) issued a notification dated 11.4.2001, the relevant paragraphs of which are quoted herein-below in extenso:

""(i) The new basic pay of each RRB employees as on 1.4.2000 would be determined by notionally granting the benefit of 6th and 7th bipartite settlement and officers wage revision w.e.f. 1.11.1992 and 1.11.1997 respectively. The formula for fitment of salary in various scales may also remain the same as was adopted for commercial bank employees. Thus as on 1.4.2000, the pay scales of the RRB employees would become equal to that of their counterparts in commercial banks.

(ii) The current payment of increase in the salary due to grant of new pay scales shall be made in such a manner that the cash outflow in a particular year on this account is not more than 50% of the operating profit of the concerned RRB as per the previous year's published balance sheet. The RRBs who have incurred operating losses in the previous year would not be able to make current payment of increased portion of the revised salary and the amount due on account of increase in salary shall be transferred to the arrear account. Similarly, if anticipated cash out flow on account of the increase in the salary is exceeding 50% of the operating profit in the last year, the current payment may be restricted only to 50% of the operating profit and the rest shall be transferred to arrear account which is to be treated in the manner stated hereunder.

(iii) There shall be a two year moratorium on the payment of arrears i.e. upto 31.3.2002 and during this period no arrear shall be payable by any RRB. After the moratorium period, the arrears may be paid in such a manner that the cash outflow on that account and the increase in wages during the current year on account of implementation of this package do not exceed 50% of the operating profit of the respective RRB for the immediate previous year. Arrears would mean increase in salary i.e. basic pay, DA and CCA due to the RRB employees by notionally granting to them wage revision w.e.f. 1.11.1992 and 1.11.1997 at par with the commercial bank employees and residual amount if any arising out of Clause (ii) above.

(iv) The House Rent Allowance (HRA) and City Compensatory Allowance (CCA) would be payable at the same rate as applicable to comparable employees in the sponsor banks and would be given prospective effect i.e. date of issue of these orders as is done in Commercial Banks.

(v) As far as other allowances are concerned, individual sponsor banks shall negotiate the same with the respective RRBs. The revised allowances shall be paid w.e.f. 1.4.2000. The ceiling on the payment shall however be as per the formula stated in (iii) above.

The RRBs may issue a comprehensive order based on the above orders indicating the revised pay scales in respect of each category of employees after getting approval of their Board of Directors.

The principles for current payment and payment of arrears spelt out in these orders should be strictly adhered to.""

4. Paragraph (i) of this Notification, making the pay-scales of the employees of Regional Rural Banks equal to their counterparts in commercial banks on 1.4.2000 is in consonance with the directions of this Court and there is no grievance on that score from any quarter. But paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of the aforesaid circular are the identical paragraphs of the package, which the Union of India had submitted in course of hearing and which had not been accepted by the employees of the Regional Rural Banks. Even the current payment of increase in salary, after determination being made became dependant upon the cash outflow in a particular year and then there was a moratorium on the payment of the arrears for a period of two years i.e. upto 31.3.2002. The aforesaid period however is coming to an end.

5. According to Mr. S.K. Dholakia and other counsel appearing for different set of employees of Regional Rural Banks, the direction not to make the current payment of the increase in salary due to the grant of the new pay-scale is directly in contravention of the judgment of this Court and, therefore, such attitude of the authorities, must be severely condemned and they should be duly punished.

6. Mr. Mukul Rohtagi, the learned Additional Solicitor General, however tried to impress upon us the circumstances under which the notification had been issued, the same being severe financial crisis and the learned Additional Solicitor General further urged that the monetary benefits of the employees of the bank will have to be so modulated so that the banks should be ultimately be closed down by merely paying the salary of the employees. Even though the financial position of the banks may not be disputed, but having regard to the directions issued by this Court, while disposing of the civil appeal and having regard to the circumstances under which such directions had been given, it would be difficult for us to sustain the plea of the union Government that the Notification is in compliance with the judgment and directions of this Court. The financial capacity of the Government cannot be pleaded as a ground for non-implementation of the directions of the Court inasmuch as even in the matter of determination of the pay-scale of the employees of the Regional Rural Banks and maintenance of parity with their counterparts, serving under the sponsored commercial banks, Justice Obul Reddi had not accepted the said plea and that award reached its finality. Since the financial capacity of the employer cannot be held to be a germane consideration for determination of the wage structure of the employees and the Parliament enacted the Act for bringing into existence these regional rural banks with the idea of helping the rural mass of the country, the employees of such rural banks cannot suffer on account of financial incapacity of the employer. We have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the issuance of notification dated 1.4.2001, by the Government of India cannot be held to be in compliance with the judgment and directions of this Court in Civil Appeal No. 2218 of 1999. But at the same time, we are of the opinion that the appropriate authority need not be punished under the provisions of the Contempt of Courts Act, even if the notification is in direct contravention of the judgment of this Court, as we do not find a case of deliberate violation. While, therefore, we do not propose to take any action against the alleged contemnors, we direct that the employees of the Regional Rural Banks should be paid their current salaries on the basis of determination made under the notification dated 11.4.2001, the new basic pay having arrived at, as on 1.4.2000 forthwith Paragraph (i) of the aforesaid notification dated 11.4.2001 should be immediately implemented and the employees should be paid accordingly. Paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of the notification are quashed and the Central Government is directed to issue a fresh notification for proper implementation of the Judgment of this Court. We make it clear that the period of moratorium with regard to the payment of arrears, since is going to be over on 31.3.2002, the arrear salary accruing to the employees be paid to them in three equal annual installments, the first being on 30th of April, 2002, the second on 30th of April, 2003 and the third on 30th April, 2004. This payment has to be made as aforesaid without being any way dependant upon any other considerations and there cannot be any distinction between the regional rural banks incurring loss and the regional rural banks, making profit. Further, the question of anticipated cash out-flow on account of increase in salary if exceeds 50% of the operating profit, then the current payment would be restricted only upto 50% is absolutely of no relevance, which was indicated in the impugned notification dated 11.4.2001. Having regard to the financial condition of the Government as well as these banks, the installment to be paid on 30.4.2002, pursuant to this order of ours, the same may be deposited in the employees' provident fund account. But all other installments will have to be paid in cash.

7. All these Interlocutory Applications and Contempt Petition are disposed of accordingly.

"

1. Leave granted. The Appellant was serving as an Additional District and Sessions Judge in the Uttar Pradesh Higher Judicial Service. He was charged with misconduct, found guilty and awarded a punishment of stoppage of two increments with cumulative effect. Aggrieved, he preferred a writ petition before the High Court in which he assailed not only the finding of the guilt but even the punishment awarded to him. A Division Bench of the High Court, while upholding the finding of guilt, took the view that instead of stoppage of two increments, the Appellant should have been punished more severely by directing his removal from service. The High Court accordingly directed issue of a notice to the Appellant to show cause why he should not be removed from service. It is that part of the order which has been assailed by the Appellant in the present appeal.

2. Appearing for the Appellant, Mr. D.K. Singh, strenuously argued that the High Court had misdirected itself in issuing a notice of enhancement of the punishment awarded to the Appellant. He submitted that by doing so, the High Court had placed the Appellant in a worse-off position, simply because he had challenged the punishment awarded to him. That was, according to Mr. Singh, legally impermissible. In support of his submissions, Mr. Singh placed reliance upon two decisions of this Court in Pradeep Kumar v. Union of India and Ors. (2005) 12 SCC 219 and Ramesh Chander Singh v. High Court of Allahabad and Anr. MANU/SC/1021/2007MANU/SC/1021/2007 : (2007) 4 SCC 247.

3. On behalf of the Respondents, it was submitted that the question whether the High Court was right in issuing a show cause notice for enhancement of the punishment awarded to the Appellant, had become academic in view of the fact that the Appellant had since retired from service. It was urged that the question whether the High Court was justified in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case to direct a show cause notice to the Appellant could, therefore, be left open and the appeal disposed of, discharging the show cause notice ordered against the Appellant.

4. The legal position, as to the powers of the High Court to direct enhancement of punishment in a writ petition arising out of disciplinary action taken against an employee, stands concluded by the decisions of this Court, referred to above. In Pradeep Kumar's case (supra), in a somewhat similar circumstances, a similar question had arisen for consideration before this Court. In that case too the High Court had found the punishment of reduction in pay and denial of increments awarded to the Appellant to be inadequate, for the gravity of the misconduct. The High Court had accordingly remanded the matter back to the disciplinary authority to award the maximum punishment of dismissal from service which direction was then assailed before this Court on the ground that the High Court had no such power to direct enhancement of punishment either by itself or by remanding the matter to the disciplinary authority. An employee complaining against the punishment awarded to him could not, observed this Court, be placed in a worse-off position for coming to the Court. The following passages from the judgment is in this regard apposite:

3. According to the Appellant, similar punishment was inflicted on the other two employees. Being aggrieved, all three employees filed separate writ petitions before the High Court. The writ petitions of the other two employees were merely dismissed as withdrawn. As far as the Appellant was concerned, the High Court not only dismissed the writ petition but also directed the punishing authority to reconsider the punishment imposed in view of the observations of the High Court and held that the maximum penalty of dismissal from service ought to have been accorded. There was a further direction that the action taken against the Appellant should be intimated to the Court as soon as possible.

4. Irrespective of the crime/offence with which the Appellant may have been charged, it was not open to the High Court to have issued such a direction. The scope of judicial review did not allow the High Court to have interfered with the punishment imposed by the disciplinary authorities on the Appellant. Besides, a writ Petitioner cannot be put in a worse position by coming to court. The directions of the High Court are not sustainable and must be set aside. We are told by the learned Counsel for the Appellant that the Respondent authority pursuant to the directions issued by the High Court, initiated proceedings against the Appellant for the purpose of imposing the penalty of dismissal from service. We have held that the direction of the High Court was wholly outside its jurisdiction. The appeals are thus allowed and the High Court's directions are set aside. The disciplinary enquiry initiated on the basis of the High Court's order is consequently also quashed. However, the writ petitions will stand dismissed. There is no order as to costs.

5. To the same effect is the decision in Ramesh Chander Singh's case (supra) where too the question whether the High Court could interfere with the order of punishment in a matter where the employee challenged the punishment awarded to him in a writ petition, fell for consideration before this Court. The question was answered in the following words:

6. Based on the enquiry report, the Appellant was served with a notice to show cause as to why his two increments should not be withheld with cumulative effect. The matter was placed before the Full Court on 20.11.1999 and the Full Court by its resolution imposed a major punishment of withholding two annual increments of the Appellant with cumulative effect. The Appellant filed a review application against the said punishment and the same was rejected. Thereupon, he filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution challenging the punishment imposed on him. By judgment dated 3.10.2005, the writ petition was dismissed and in the very same judgment the Appellant was directed to show cause within three weeks from the date of the judgment as to why the High Court should not consider substitution of the punishment imposed, by removing him from service. Pursuant to the notice, the Appellant appeared and presented his case before the Division Bench. By judgment dated 25.11.2005, the Appellant was reduced to the rank next below, that is, Civil Judge (Senior Division). Both the judgment of the Division bench are challenged before us.

6. We have, in the light of the above decisions, no hesitation in holding that the High Court had fallen in a palpable error in directing issuance of a show cause notice to the Appellant The Appellant could not, as observed earlier, be placed in a worse-off situation because of his having sought redress against the punishment awarded to him by the disciplinary authority which in the instant case is the High Court itself. In the result, we allow this appeal and direct setting aside of that part of the order passed by the High Court whereby the High Court had directed the issue of show cause notice to the Appellant for award of a heavier punishment upon him. The fact that the Appellant has since retired from service, is only an added feature why the direction of the High Court should be set aside. The parties are left to bear their own costs.

1. This appeal is directed against the Order dated 16th June, 2000, passed in Election Petition No.29 of 1999.The aforesaid Election Petition had been filed by the appellant , challenging the validity of the election to the House of People from the Bangalore North Parliamentary Constituency , in which election, respondent No.1 was declared to have been elected. In the election petition, the Election Commissioner, the Returning Officer and the Chief Electoral Officer of the State of Karnataka had been arrayed as respondents 6, 7 and 8. Those respondents filed an application before the High Court of Karnataka for their deletion inter alia on the ground that under Section 82 of the Representation of the People Act, it has been clearly indicated that who should be the parties to an election petition and since they have been unnecessarily impleaded, they should be deleted. The High Court by the impugned judgment having deleted the said respondents 6, 7 and 8 from the array of parties, the present appeal has been preferred.

2. Mr. R. Venkataramani, the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant contended that the election petition having been filed. Challenging the validity of the election of respondent No.1, on the grounds contained in Section 100(1)(d)(iii)(iv) and non-compliance with the provisions of the Constitution and the Rules by the election machinery having been alleged, respondents 7 and 8 at least ought to have been held to be proper parties and there could not have been an order of deletion. According to the learned counsel , these respondents 7 and 8 having failed to conform to the mandatory guidelines enacted by the Election Commission of India, as contained in the hand book of the Returning Officer and those guidelines being treated as an integral part of the rules as well as Article 324 of the Constitution respondents 7 and 8 became proper parties to the election petition, in view of the nature of allegations pertaining to their official conduct. That being the position the learned Single Judge, who was in session of the matter, erroneously deleted the said respondents 7 and 8. Mr. Venkataramani however seriously does not challenge the order of deletion, so far as respondent No.6 is concerned.

3. Mr. S. Muralidhar, the learned counsel appearing for the Election Commission, on the other hand submitted that the question of parties to an election petition is concluded by two earlier decisions of this Court in the case of Jyoti Basu and Ors. v. Debi Ghosal and Ors. MANU/SC/0144/1982MANU/SC/0144/1982 : [1982]3SCR318 : [1982]3SCR318 andB. Sundara Rami Reddy v. Election Commission of India and Ors. and therefore, the High Court was wholly justified in directing the deletion of those respondents from the array of parties and by such deletion , there has been no illegality requiring interference by this Court. Mr. Muralidhar, further contended that the Representation of the People Act being a full code by itself prescribing the procedure to be followed and indicating the parties to be arrayed to an election petition and respondents 7 and 8, not coming within the ambit of the said provision, the High Court rightly deleted them and that order need not be interfered with by this Court. The learned counsel lastly urged that in view of the nature of allegations made, the person making those allegations is required to prove the same and therefore, there is no justifiable reason, why the Election Officer or the Returning Officer should be permitted to be added as a party to the election petition.

4. In order to examine the correctness of the rival submissions , it would be necessary for us to have a bird's eye view of the relevant provisions of the Act and the different case laws on the point. But one thing must be borne in mind that in the case in hand, the allegations made were in relation to the use of voting electoral machines, under Section 61Aof the Act. The gravamen of the allegations in the election petition are that the Returning Officer as well as the Chief Electoral Officer had not complied with several provisions of the Conduct of Election Rules and respondents 7 and 8 had not acted in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Election Commission of India. The relevant paragraphs of the election petition pertaining to the infraction of Rules committed by respondent 7 and 8 are paragraphs 20a, 20d, 20f , 25 and 28. The Representation of the People Act, 1951[hereinafter referred to as 'the Act'] is an Act, providing for the conduct of elections to the House of Parliament and to the House of Legislature of each State and it provides the qualifications and disqualifications for Membership of those Houses, the Corrupt Practices and other offences in connection with such elections and the decisions of doubts and disputes arising out of or in connection with such elections. The general procedure at elections has been enumerated in Chapter III. Section 61 of the Act provides the procedure for preventing personation of electors and Section 61A which was inserted by Act 1 of 1989 w.e.f.15.3.1989, deals with Voting machines at elections. Section 66 provides for declaration of result and Section 67 provides for submission of a Report of the result to the appropriate authority and the Election Commission and in case of an election to a House of Parliament, to the Secretary of that House by the Returning Officer, soon after the declaration of the result. It also provides for publication of the name of the elected candidate in the official gazette. Part VI starting with Section 79 deals with disputes regarding elections. Under Section 80 of the Act, no election shall be called in question except by an election petition presented in accordance with the provisions of this Part. Presentation of petition is dealt with in Section 81 and such petition could be presented on one or more of the grounds specified in Sub-section (1) of Section 100 and Section 101. Section 82 stipulates as to who shall join as respondents to an election petition. Section 82 may be quoted herein-below in extenso:-

""Section 82. Parties of the petition:- A petitioner shall join as respondents to his petition---

(a) where the petitioner, in addition to claiming declaration that the election of all or any of the returned candidates is void, claims a further declaration that he himself or any other candidate has been duly elected, all the contesting candidates other than the petitioner and where no such further declaration is claimed, all the returned candidates ; and

(b) any other candidate against whom allegations of any corrupt practice are made in the petition.""

5. Section 83 provides as to what should contain in an election petition and Section 86 in Chapter III deals with trial of election petitions. Section 87 is the procedure for such trial and it provides that every election petition shall be tried as nearly as may be, in accordance with the procedure applicable under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 to the trial of suits. As stated earlier, Section 100 indicates the grounds on which an election can be declared to be void and Section 101 indicates the grounds on which a candidate other than the returned candidate may be declared to have been elected . We are not concerned with the other provisions of the Act in the case in hand. An appeal to the Supreme Court has been provided under Section 116A. On a plain reading of Section 82, which indicates as to the person who can be joined as a respondent to an election petition, the conclusion is irresistible that the returned candidate, the candidate against whom allegations of any corrupt practice have been made are to be joined as party respondent when declaration is sought for holding the election of the returned candidate to be void and when a prayer is made as to any other candidate to be declared to be duly elected, then all the contesting candidates are required to be made party respondents. On a literal interpretation of the aforesaid provisions of Section 82,therefore, it can be said that an election petition which does not make the person enumerated in Section 82 of the Act, as party respondents, is liable to be dismissed. The two decisions of this Court directly on the question are the cases of Jyoti Basu and Ors. v. Debi Ghosal and Ors., MANU/SC/0144/1982MANU/SC/0144/1982 : [1982]3SCR318 : [1982]3SCR318 and B. Sundara Rami Reddy v. Election Commission of India and Ors. . In the former case, Chinnappa Reddy, J, speaking for the Court , held that right to elect or to be elected or dispute regarding election are neither fundamental rights nor common law rights but are confined to the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder and consequently, rights and remedies are all limited to those provided by the statutory provisions. On the question of Joinder of parties referring to Section 82 and 86(4) of the Representation of the People Act, it was held that the contest of the election petition is designed to be confined to the candidates at the election and all others are excluded and therefore, only those may be joined as respondents to an election petition, who are mentioned in Section 82 and 86(4) and no others. An argument had been advanced in that case that even if somebody may not be a necessary party under Section 82 of the Act, but yet he could be added as a proper party as provided in Order I Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure. But the Court rejected that contention on a finding that the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code apply to election disputes only as far as may be and subject to the provisions of the Act and any rules made thereunder and the provisions of the Code cannot be invoked to permit which is not permissible under the Act. It was in that context the Court further observed that the concept of 'proper parties' is and remain alien to an election dispute under the Act. This decision was followed in B. Sundara Rami Reddy's case,MANU/SC/0415/1991MANU/SC/0415/1991 : (1992)ILLJ281SC , referred to supra and it was reiterated that the concept of 'proper party' is and must remain alien to an election dispute under the Act and only those may be joined as respondents to an election petition who are mentioned in Section 82 and 86(4) of the Act and no others. The Court in this case added that however desirable and expedient it may appear to be non-else shall be joined as respondents. Mr. Venkataramani, the learned senior counsel, appearing for the appellant, contended that the law enunciated in the two decisions and the observations made are too wide and while Section 82 casts an obligation on an election petitioner to join those mentioned in clauses(a) and (b) as partly respondent, it does not put an embargo for addition of any other person in an appropriate case depending upon the nature of allegation made and consequently , the expression ""any other"" in the two decisions referred to above, must be held not to have been correctly used . Mr. Venkataramani relied upon the observations made by this Court in M.S. Gill's case, MANU/SC/0209/1977MANU/SC/0209/1977 : [1978]2SCR272 : [1978]2SCR272 , wherein the Court had observed that the Constitution contemplates a free and fair election and vests comprehensive responsibilities of superintendence, direction and control of the conduct of elections in the Election Commission . This responsibility may cover powers, duties and functions of many sorts, administrative or other depending on the circumstances and submitted that the basis of electoral democracy being a free and fair election and fairness imports an obligation to see that no wrong- doer candidate benefits from his own wrong. In case where allegations are made against the Returning Officer or the Chief Electoral Officer with regard to the conduct of the election , there should be no bar to array them as parties and according to Mr. Venkataramani in Gill's case, the Chief Election Commissioner was a party and, therefore, this Court in Jyoti Basu as well as the subsequent case, having not noticed the aforesaid judgment of the larger Bench, the latter decision will be of no assistance. We are not in a position to accept the submission of Mr. Venkataramani inasmuch as in Gill's case, an order of the Election Commissioner was under challenge by filing a writ petition and it was not an election petition under the provisions of the Representation of the People Act. There is no dispute with the proposition that a free and fair electoral process is the foundation of our democracy , but the question for consideration is, whether by indicating in the Act as to who shall be arrayed as party, the Court would be justified in allowing some others as parties to an election petition. For the aforesaid proposition, Gill's case is no authority. Mr. Venkataramani then relied upon the decision of Calcutta High Court in Dwijendra Lal SenGupta v. Hare Krishna Konar, MANU/WB/0044/1963MANU/WB/0044/1963 : AIR1963Cal218 : AIR1963Cal218 , where the question came up for consideration directly and the Calcutta High Court did observe that the Returning Officer may nevertheless in an appropriate case be a ""proper party"" who may be added as party to the election petition and undoubtedly , the aforesaid observation supports the contention of Mr. Venkararamani. Following the aforesaid decision , a learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court in the case of H.R. Gokhale v. Bharucha Nashir C. and Ors . MANU/MH/0061/1969MANU/MH/0061/1969 : AIR1969Bom177 : AIR1969Bom177 , had also observed that the observations of Shah, J in Ram Sewak Yadav's case, MANU/SC/0177/1964MANU/SC/0177/1964 : [1964]6SCR238 : [1964]6SCR238 in paragraph (6) is not intended to lay down that the Returning Officer can in no event to be a proper party to an election petition. But both these aforesaid decisions of the Calcutta High Court and Bombay High Court had been considered by this Court in Jyoti Basu case and the Court took the view that the public policy and legislative wisdom both seem to point to an interpretation of the provisions of the Representation of the People Act which does not permit the joining, as parties, of persons other than those mentioned in Section 82 and 86(4). The Court also in paragraph (12)considered the consequences if persons other than those mentioned in Section 82 are permitted to be added as parties and held that the necessary consequences would be an unending, disorderly election dispute with no hope of achieving the goal contemplated by Section 86(6) of the Act. In the aforesaid premises, we reiterate the views taken by this Court in Jyoti Basu' case and reaffirmed in the letter case in B. Sundara Rami Reddy and we see no infirmity with the impugned judgment, requiring our interference under Article 136 of the Constitution. This appeal accordingly fails and is dismissed.

Shiva Kirti Singh, J.

1. The leading matter - C.A. No. 6036 of 2012 as well as C.A. No. 6061 of 2012 are statutory appeals arising out of a common order dated 2.7.2012 passed by Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (for short, 'APTEL') whereby pleas Under Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 to explain the alleged delay in preferring claims by the common Respondent - M/s. Lanco Kondapalli Power Ltd. (for brevity referred to as 'M/s. LANCO') a power generating company before the Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (hereinafter referred to as 'the Commission') has been accepted and as a result the main claim in the leading matter relating to Bill for Capacity Charges and in the other appeal for Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) for 2001-2005 have been remanded for a follow up order by the Commission on the actual claims and interest. In respect of MAT, a concession on merits was recorded in respect of period 2006-2009 and for the earlier period (2001-2005) the contest was confined only to issue of limitation, as evidenced by Original Order of Commission dated 13.6.2011. Hence, through a SLP leading to C.A. No. 6835 of 2015, the Appellant has chosen to make a direct challenge to aforesaid order to explain and overcome the alleged concession in respect of claim for reimbursement of MAT for the entire period of 2001-2009. C.A. No. 6138 of 2012 is a statutory appeal to again challenge MAT for 2006-2009 but directed against appellate order dated 20.7.2012 by APTEL. The last matter, C.A. No. 9304 of 2013 arises out of a SLP against the original order of Commission dated 8.8.2013 relating to MAT claim for the period 2009-2012. Since issues are same or similar between the same Appellant and Respondent in all these appeals, they have been heard together and shall be governed by this common judgment. Unless otherwise indicated the facts have been noted from the records of the main matter, i.e., C.A. No. 6036 of 2012.

2. Instead of merits of bills raised by M/s. LANCO for capacity charges the issue of limitation has assumed greater significance and has thrown up two important points. First, whether the Limitation Act is applicable to a claim before the Commission and if the answer is in positive, then second, whether APTEL's order reversing the views of Commission and accepting claim Under Section 14 of the Limitation Act is in accordance with law or not. It is not in dispute that if the order of APTEL is upheld, the issue of correctness or validity of capacity charges will stand remanded for decision by the Commission in accordance with law. So far as claim of M/s. LANCO for reimbursement of MAT for the period 2001-2005 is concerned, it shall stand rejected if APTEL's order on the issue of limitation is reversed, otherwise such claim for the aforesaid period as well as for later period upto 2012 will be governed by the present judgment on the issue of legality and admissibility of claim for MAT.

3. Before adverting to the issues noticed above and the rival contentions, it will be useful to notice the essential facts relevant for deciding the issues. M/s. LANCO is engaged in the generation and sale of electricity. Its Registered Office is at Hyderabad and it has set up its power project at Kondapalli Industrial Development Area in Krishna District of Andhra Pradesh. A.P. Power Co-ordination Committee, the Appellant No. 1, as the name suggests, was constituted on 07.06.2005 to ensure coordination between the four distribution companies of Andhra Pradesh who are Appellant Nos. 3 to 6. M/s. Transmission Corporation of Andhra Pradesh (APTRANSCO) is the second Appellant. At the relevant time the Appellant No. 2 was engaged in procurement of power for the Distribution Companies. In the first phase of power sector reforms, Andhra Pradesh State Electricity Board was unbundled into Generation and Transmission Corporation and subsequently the four Distribution Companies were notified by the Government on 31.3.2000 on account of unbundling of the Transmission Corporation in the subsequent phase of reforms.

4. There is no dispute between the parties that the erstwhile A.P. State Electricity Board had invited bids for short gestation power projects. M/s. LANCO also submitted its bid which was accepted by the Board and approved by the Government of Andhra Pradesh leading to a Power Purchase Agreement (for brevity, 'PPA') dated 31.3.1997. M/s. LANCO then set up a 355 MW (ISO) Combined Cycle Gas Power Plant. The completion of the plant took more than the scheduled period of 16 months. It is not necessary to go into reasons for the delay in the present proceeding. It will suffice to note that M/s. LANCO declared 25.10.2000 as the date of commissioning of their project but this was not accepted as the Commercial Operation Date (COD) by APTRANSCO. However, M/s. LANCO continued to generate power and delivered it to grid. It raised bills from 19.9.2000. While the charges for the energy delivered were accepted, the bill for capacity charges was disallowed on the ground that it was not in accordance with the PPA. On 8.9.2003 M/s. LANCO issued a notice of arbitration under Article 14 of the PPA. There is some dispute as to whether this notice was only for invoking the mechanism for informal dispute resolution or also a notice for resolution of dispute by Arbitration. The Appellants through a reply dated 24.9.2003 requested for an ordinary meeting to discuss pending problems before considering the request for arbitration. On 14.10.2003 M/s. LANCO wrote a letter intimating the nomination of its Company's Secretary as its representative to participate in the proceeding for informal dispute resolution required by Article 14.1. It requested the other side to designate their representative and to intimate the date and venue of the meeting. The Appellants through a letter dated 25.11.2003 designated their Chief General Manager to act as their representative but the meeting scheduled could not take place. On 26.3.2004, M/s. LANCO issued another notice for arbitration and intimated the name of Justice B.P. Jeevan Reddy as its arbitrator. Through a letter dated 8.4.2004, APTRANSCO raised various grounds in support of its stance that the arbitration clause was not enforceable, particularly in the light of Section 86(1)(f) of the Electricity Act, 2003.

5. M/s. LANCO did not accept the stand of Appellants and filed an Arbitration Application bearing No. 31 of 2004 on 27.4.2004 before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad Under Section 11(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 seeking appointment of arbitrator for APTRANSCO so that the disputes raised by it could be resolved through arbitration. APTRANSCO contested the maintainability of arbitration proceedings on various grounds including Section 86(1)(f) of the Electricity Act, 2003. While the matter before the High Court was still pending, the scope and effect of Section 86(1)(f) of the Electricity Act was decided by a judgment of this Court dated March 13, 2008 in the case of Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd. v. Essar Power Ltd. MANU/SC/1055/2008MANU/SC/1055/2008 : (2008) 4 SCC 755. This Court held that all disputes between the licencee such as the Appellants and generating companies such as M/s. LANCO require adjudication only by the State Commission which is alone competent to either adjudicate the disputes or refer them for arbitration and to appoint arbitrator. It was clearly held that it is the State Commission or its nominee Under Section 86(1)(f) of the Electricity Act, 2003 and not the Chief Justice or his nominee Under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 who will have the authority to appoint an arbitrator if it decides to refer the disputes to arbitration. This Court further clarified that except the power of appointing arbitrator getting shifted to the State Commission, conduct of arbitration even Under Section 86(1)(f) of the Electricity Act would be governed by provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Only in cases of conflict the Electricity Act would prevail.

6. In view of law settled by the judgment in the case of Gujarat Urja (supra), the Arbitration Application No. 31 of 2004 was closed by the High Court on 18.3.2009 with liberty to M/s. LANCO to approach the Commission Under Section 86(1)(f) of the Electricity Act. M/s. LANCO filed O.P. No. 33 of 2009 before the Commission on 5.6.2009 to claim capacity charges on the basis of bills raised from 15.9.2000 onwards to 11.1.2001. The Appellants resisted the claim inter alia on the ground of limitation. The Appellants preferred a specific application for rejecting the O.P. No. 33 of 2009 on the ground of limitation. M/s. LANCO preferred a reply in which Section 14 of the Limitation Act was invoked for seeking exclusion of time when the arbitration proceeding had remained pending with the High Court in the form of Arbitration Application No. 31 of 2004. The Commission rejected the claim by order dated 13.6.2011 on the ground of limitation by holding that the time spent in the arbitration proceedings did not merit exclusion Under Section 14 of the Limitation Act because it had not been pursued in good faith. M/s. LANCO preferred Appeal No. 129 of 2011 before APTEL. That appeal was allowed by the impugned judgment presently under appeal, dated 2.7.2012. APTEL reversed the findings of the Commission on the issue of limitation and directed the Commission to pass appropriate follow up order on the actual claims and interest.

7. So far as claim of M/s. LANCO for reimbursement of MAT for various periods is concerned, the claim for the period 2001-2005 was rejected by the Commission on the ground of limitation but it got revived on account of common appellate order by APTEL dated 2.7.2012 and after the remand only a consequential order is required to be passed by the Commission. For other periods, the claim for reimbursement of MAT has been allowed in favour of M/s. LANCO. The Commission allowed the claim for the periods 2006-2009 and 2009-2012 on account of its earlier order in respect of similar claim in another case which elicited a concession by the counsel for the Appellants, although in the written statement before the Commission the Appellants had seriously contested such claim on merits. It is contended by Mr. V. Giri, learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant that the concession was misconceived and unauthorized. Learned Senior Counsel for M/s. LANCO, Mr. Sundaram, fairly conceded that the issue relating to claim for reimbursement of MAT may be heard and decided by us on merits and accordingly the parties have been heard in detail on the merits of such claim for the entire period, i.e., from 2001 to 2012. But in case the claim of MAT for 2001-2005 is held by us to be barred by limitation, it will not be considered on merits.

8. Appearing for the Appellants, learned senior advocate Mr. V. Giri pointed out that in the impugned order under appeal APTEL has not considered the claim of capacity charges on merits and therefore this Court is not required to go into facts for deciding the merits of bills for capacity charges. On the issue of limitation he contended that there was no issue raised before the Commission that bar of limitation as per Limitation Act is not applicable to the proceedings before the Commission. He referred to the arguments advanced on behalf of M/s. LANCO before APTEL to highlight that even in appeal it claimed exclusion of time spent in arbitration proceedings Under Section 14(2) of the Limitation Act and hence this Court should not allow M/s. LANCO to now urge that the Limitation Act cannot apply and hence there will be no bar of any limitation in preferring a claim before the State Commission. We have noticed that in para 28 of the judgment under appeal APTEL has noted that the Appellant No. 1 (M/s. LANCO) does not seriously dispute the fact that the Limitation Act would be applicable to the present case. But learned Counsels have conceded that the issue whether Limitation Act is applicable or not is one of law and accordingly the parties have advanced detailed submissions on this issue. Hence we propose to consider these submissions also.

9. From the above stand of the parties, the following issues emerge for our consideration and adjudication:-

(i) Whether the Limitation Act, 1963, particularly Section 3 and the Schedule will apply to any action instituted before the Commission Under Section 86(1)(f) of the Electricity Act, 2003?

(ii) Whether the impugned order passed by APTEL permitting application of principles emerging from Section 14 of the Limitation Act, is against Law so as to warrant interference?

(iii) And whether on merits the claim for reimbursement of MAT is in contravention of relevant terms and conditions of the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)?

10. At this juncture, relevant provisions or articles of PPA need to be noticed. They are as follows:

Article 3.8 - Claims for Taxes on Income

Any advance Income tax payable for the Project in any month supported by a certificate of a chartered accountant approved by the Board (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be reimbursed by the Board. After the tax assessment is completed for any year, and the liability thereon is determined by the taxation authorities in India, the excess or shortfall in the tax liability so determined will be adjusted in the supplementary bill (as defined in Article 5.5) for the succeeding month or on the due date of payment thereof, whichever is later, subject to Article 3.9. Tax to be reimbursed will be calculated on the income from the project only, and calculated on the assumption that the Company is engaged solely in the ownership, design, financing, construction, operation and maintenance of the Project and will not include tax reimbursements of the previous year.

5.5. - Supplementary Bills

For payments due to the Company for reimbursement of taxes on income, incentives or taxes and duties levied on generation and/or sale of electricity, payments for periods of political Force Majeure affecting either Party or Non-Political Force Majeure affecting the Board or any other adjustments or payments due to the Company hereunder, the Company shall present a supplementary bill, in such form as may be mutually agreed upon by the Board and the Company, (duly supported by supporting data). Each supplementary bill shall be payable by the Board on the Due Date of Payment, except in case of supplementary bill for taxes on income. At least thirty (30) days prior to the date when income tax is required to be paid by the Company, the Company shall submit to the Board a supplementary bill for the same. This bill shall be payable by the Board within twenty-five (25) days of its presentation to the Board by the Company or at least five (5) days before the date on which the tax is required to be paid by the Company, whichever is later.

5.7 - Billing Disputes

Notwithstanding any dispute as to all or any portion of any bill submitted by the company to the Board, the Board shall pay the full amount of the bill provided that the amount of the bill is based on (a) a meter reading that has either been signed by both Parties or certified by the Company with respect to the Board's refusal to sign within three (3) days of the meter reading date and (b) the provisions of this Agreement. The Board shall notify the Company of any disputed amount, and the Company shall rectify the defect or otherwise notify its rejection of the disputed amount, with reasons, within five (5) days of the reference by the Board, falling agreement on which the provisions of Article 14 shall apply with respect thereto. If the resolution of any dispute requires the Company to reimburse the Board, the amount to be reimbursed shall bear interest at the Working Capital Rate applicable to the Board from the date of payment by the Board to the date of reimbursement. The Board may not dispute any amount after sixty (60) days following the Due Date of Payment therefore.

11.1 - Definition of Law

For the purposes of this Agreement, ""Law"" means the constitution of India and any act, rule, regulation, directive, notification, order or instruction having the force of Law enacted or issued by any competent legislature, or Government Agency.

11.2 - Definition of Change in Law

For the purposes of this agreement, ""Change in Law"" means

(i) any enactment or issue of any new Law,

(ii) any amendment, alteration, modification or repeal of any existing Law or any new or modified directive or order thereunder,

(iii) any change in the application or interpretation of any Law by a competent legislature or Government Agency in India which is contrary to the existing accepted application or interpretation thereof, in each case coming into effect after the date of this Agreement, provision for which has not been made elsewhere in the Agreement.

11.4 - Additional/Reduced Expenditures or Other Increased/Reduced Costs due to a Change in Law or Change in Permits

(a) Within sixty (60) days after the COD of the first Generating Unit or the end of any Tariff Year, the Company shall determine after accounting for the net economic effects on the Company during the period prior to the COD of the first Generating Unit or, as the case may be, such Tariff Year of any Changes in Law or Changes in Permits, based on an accounting conducted by an independent chartered accountant reasonably acceptable to the Board. If as a result of such accounting, the company suffers an increase in costs or a reduction in after-tax cash flow or any other net economic burden which it would not have experienced but for such changes in Law or Changes in Permits (taking into account the reasonable costs of financing of any capital improvement in the period prior to the COD of the first Generating Unit or, as the case may be, such Tariff Year), the aggregate economic affect of which exceeds the equivalent of Rupees three (3) crores per 100 MW or pro-rata for any part thereof during the period prior to the COD of the first generating unit and Rupees one (1) crore per 100 MW or pro-rata for any part thereof during the period after the COD of the first Generating Unit, during any Tariff Year (excluding cost adjustments in respect of Changes in Law or Changes in Permits from any prior period), the Company may notify the Board of any proposed amendments to this Agreement required to put the Company in the same economic position it would have occupied in the absence of such cost increase reduction in the net after-tax cash flow or any other economic burden. Such notice shall be accompanied by a certification of the Company's independent chartered accountant and a reasonably detailed explanation of certification of any officer of the Company respecting the basis for such net economic burden increase. The amount of an net economic burden claimed by the Company shall be net of any insurance proceeds received in respect thereof.

(b) Within sixty (60) days after the COD of the first Generating Unit or the end of any Tariff Year, if after accounting as provided in subsection (a) for the net economic effects on the Company during the period prior to the COD of the first Generating Unit or as the case may be, such tariff year of any changes in law or Changes in Permits, the Company experiences a reduction in costs or an increase in after-tax cash flow or any other net economic benefit which it would not have experienced but for such Changes in Law or Changes in Permits, the aggregate economic effect of which exceeds the equivalent of Rs. 3 crore per 100 MW or pro-rata for any part thereof during the period prior to the COD of the first Generating Unit or Rupees one (1) crore per 100 MW or pro-rata for any part thereof, following the COD of the first Generating Unit, during any tariff Year, the Company shall provide to the Board results of such accounting together with a certificate of the Independent chartered accountant and the Board, in response thereto may notify the company of any proposed amendments to this Agreement required in its good faith judgment to put the Company in the same economic position it would have occupied in the absence of such cost reduction, increase in the net after-tax cash flow or any other economic benefit. Such notice shall be accompanied by a reasonably detailed explanation of a certification of an officer of the Company respecting the basis for such decrease.

(c) Only increased costs which are necessarily and unavoidably incurred in complying with or as a direct result of the Changes in Law or Changes in Permits taking into account, all reasonable steps which may be taken by the Company to minimize such increased costs, shall be considered as increased costs for the purposes of this Article.

(d) As soon as practicable during the period prior to the COD of the first Generating Unit or any Tariff Year after the Company becomes aware of any Change in Law or Change in Permits which could reasonably be expected to give rise to an increase/reduction in costs or reduction/increase in after-tax cash flow pursuant to paragraph (a) and (b), the Company shall provide an interim notice thereof to the Board describing, to the extent possible, the expected effect on the costs and the cash flow of the Company. The Company shall consult with the Board regarding such increased expenditures and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to implement the Board's recommendations, if any, to minimize such increased expenditures consistent with Prudent Utility Practices and the Company's obligations under this Agreement. If prior to the end of any Tariff year the Company demonstrates on the basis of a certification of its chartered accountant that any Change in Law or Change in Permits would result in the Company's being unable to meet its payment obligations to its lenders under the Financing Documents on a current basis, then in addition to the Company's right under Sub-section (a) but notwithstanding the time period for exercising such rights specified therein, the Company shall be entitled to propose amendments to this Agreement as provided in Sub-section(a) and the Parties shall consider such proposal as provided in subsection (e) below, provided that any benefits which the Company is eligible to receive under subsection (a) shall be reduced by any benefits received by the Company prior to the end of the relevant period under this subsection.

(e) Within thirty (30) days after receiving any proposal pursuant to paragraph (a), (b) or (d), the Parties shall meet and agree on either amendments to this Agreement or alternative arrangements to implement the foregoing. If no such agreement has been reached within ninety (90) days after any meeting pursuant to Article 11.3(a), (b) or (d), as the case may be, the proposals of the Parties shall be submitted to the Independent chartered accountant referred to in paragraphs (a), (b) and (d), as the case may be.

14.1 - Informal Dispute Resolution

(a) Each Party shall designate in writing to the other Party a representative who shall be authorized to resolve any dispute arising under this Agreement in an equitable manner.

(b) If the designated representatives are unable to resolve a dispute under this Agreement within fifteen (15) days, such dispute shall be referred by such representatives to a senior officer designated by the Company and a senior officer designated by the Board, respectively, who shall attempt to resolve the dispute within a further period of fifteen (15) days.

(c) The Parties hereto agree to use their best efforts to attempt to resolve all disputes arising hereunder promptly, equitably and in good faith, and further agree to provide each other with reasonable access during normal business hours to any and all non-privileged records, information and data pertaining to any such dispute.

14.2 - Arbitration

(a) In the event that any dispute is not resolved between the Parties pursuant to Article 14.1, then such disputes shall be settled exclusively and finally by arbitration. It is specifically understood and agreed that any dispute that cannot be resolved between the Parties, including any matter relating to the interpretation of this Agreement, shall be submitted to arbitration irrespective of the magnitude thereof, and the amount in dispute or whether such dispute would otherwise be considered justiciable or ripe for resolution by any court or arbitral tribunal. This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder shall remain in full force and effect pending the award in such arbitration proceedings, which award shall determine whether and when termination of this Agreement if relevant shall become effective.

11. Although, we were taken through various other Articles of PPA but it is not imperative to reproduce all such provisions. Article 3.1 provides for capacity charge which is required to be computed as per Article 3.2 and is meant to be paid by the Board. This is in respect of the Cumulative Available Energy provided by the Project in respect of any tariff year, upto (but not exceeding) an amount calculated on the basis of Prescribed Plant Load factor. Since the issue of capacity charge is not required to be addressed by us on merits, further details need not detain us. Clause 3.8 has been read over again and again because it is of immense significance in deciding the issue relating to MAT. Article 5 contains various Sub-articles relating to billing and payment. They provide for monthly tariff bills which are payable by the Board or the licensee on the Due Date of Payment. The supplementary bills are covered by Article 5.5. They cover different items and are required to be supported by supporting data. Such bills are also payable on the Due Date of Payment, except the supplementary bill for taxes on income which is to be submitted at least 30 days prior to the time when the income tax is required to be paid by the generating company. Such bill is payable by the Board within 25 days of presentation or at least 5 days before the date on which the tax is required to be paid by the company, whichever is later.

12. Article 5.7 relates to billing disputes and it refers to the provisions of Article 14 which governs Arbitration including Informal Dispute Resolution. Article 11 caters to the effects of Change in Law upon the rights and liabilities of the parties. This has assumed relevance in the present context on account of stand taken by the Appellant that MAT does not fall under Article 3.8 governing claims for Taxes on Income but under Article 11.4 which provides an altogether different procedure for making claim for additional costs by the company on account of any Change in Law etc. In this context it may usefully be noted that Article 1 of PPA contains definitions for the purposes of the agreement. Article 1.2 adopts definition of several terms as defined in the Indian Electricity (Supply Act) 1948 and set out in Schedule B to the Agreement. Article 1.4 contains various general provisions such as - unless the context otherwise requires, the singular shall include plural etc. and vice versa and that "".......a reference to any Law shall be construed as a reference to such Law as from time to time amended or re-enacted.""

13. Mr. Giri drew our attention to various provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003 particularly to Section 86 providing for various functions of a State Commission which include the function under Clause (f) in Sub-Section (1) empowering the Commission to ""adjudicate upon the disputes between the licensees and generating companies and to refer any dispute for arbitration."" He also referred to Section 94 which vests the Commission, for purposes of any inquiry or proceedings under this Act, with same powers as are vested in Civil Court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in respect of various matters such as summoning and enforcing the attendance of any person and examining him on oath; discovery and production of any document etc; receiving evidence on affidavit; requisitioning of any public record; issuing commission for the examination of witnesses; reviewing its decisions, directions and orders; and any other matter which may be prescribed by the Commission. The Commission shall also have powers to pass suitable interim order and authorize any suitable person to represent the interest of the consumers in the proceedings before it. Section 95 declares that all proceedings before the Commission shall be deemed to be judicial proceedings within the meaning of Sections 193 and 228 of the Indian Penal Code and it shall be deemed to be a Civil Court for the purposes of Sections 345 and 346 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Section 158 is a solitary provision in Part XVI which provides for arbitration under the heading ""Dispute Resolution"". According to Section 158, any matter directed to be determined by Arbitration, unless there is expressed provision to the contrary in the license of a licensee, shall be determined by such person or persons as the Commission may nominate in that behalf on the application of either party; but in all other respects the Arbitration shall be subject to the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.

14. On the basis of powers and functions of the Commission highlighted above and on account of law declared in Gujarat Urja (supra) as well as in Tamil Nadu Generation & Distribution Corpn. Ltd. v. PPN Power Generating Co. (P) Ltd., MANU/SC/0271/2014MANU/SC/0271/2014 : (2014) 11 SCC 53, the contention of Mr. Giri is that in discharge of its functions to adjudicate all disputes between the licensees and generating companies and/or in referring a dispute to arbitration Under Section 86(1)(f) of the Electricity Act, the Commission deserves to be treated as a substitute and therefore equivalent of civil court for the purpose of attracting the bar of limitation provided under the Limitation Act, 1963. According to him the law laid down by this Court that Limitation Act applies only to civil courts in the strict sense of the term requires reconsideration in an appropriate case but in the present matter, since in the case of PPN Power Generating Co. (P) Ltd. (supra) it has been categorically held that the State Commission discharges judicial functions and judicial power of far reaching effect and has essential trapping of the Courts, the same should be sufficient to make the Limitation Act applicable to petitions or applications that come before the Commission requiring adjudication even of matters arising purely out of contract like in the present case and not from the statutory provisions of the Electricity Act. He also advanced a supplementary or alternative submission that there is nothing in the Electricity Act, 2003 to restore to any party the right to sue for a cause which has already become barred by law of Limitation, rather under the mandate of Section 175 of the Electricity Act, the Limitation Act has to be given full respect as a law for the time being in force unless any provision of the Limitation Act is found to be inconsistent with the Electricity Act. Only in a situation of conflict, the electricity Act will have a superior or overriding force by virtue of Section 174 of the Electricity Act.

15. Yet another submission of Mr. Giri is that the matter does not attract Section 2(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for brevity 'Arbitration Act') rather Section 43 of the Arbitration Act shall govern the rights of the parties and it mandates that the Limitation Act, 1963 shall apply to arbitrations as it applies to proceedings in courts. It may however be noted here that in the case of PPN Power Generating Co. (P) Ltd. (supra) in para 65, the Court held that the Limitation Act would not be applicable in such matters for various reasons including Section 2(4) of the Arbitration Act which was extracted to highlight that Sub-section (1) of Section 40, Sections 41 and 43 all in Part I of the Arbitration Act, would not apply to arbitration under any other enactment. Only rest of the Limitation Act would be applicable to the extent not inconsistent with the other enactment or any Rule made thereunder. On that basis in Paragraph 66 it was held that the provisions with regard to Limitation Act Under Section 43 of the Arbitration Act would not be applicable to statutory-arbitrations conducted under the Electricity Act, 2003.

16. In fairness to the submission of Mr. Giri, it is noted that in the PPN Power Generating Co. (P) Ltd. (supra), in Paragraphs 64 and 68, this Court was satisfied on facts itse"

N. Santosh Hegde, J.

1. Leave granted in SLP (SIC) No. CC 6293/02 & SLP (SIC) No. CC 6307/02. In the connected appeals, leave has already been granted. All these matters raised common question of law and facts, hence, have been clubbed together.

2. The West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission (the Commission) by an order dated 7.11.2001 determined the tariff for the sale of electricity by the Calcutta Electricity Supply Company Ltd. (the Company) for the year 2000-2001 and 2001-2002. Being aggrieved by the said determination of tariff, the Company preferred an appeal before the High Court of Calcutta under Section 27 of the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act, (the 1998 Act). The High Court by the impugned judgment has allowed the appeal of the Company by itself re-determining the tariff and enhancing the same. It is against this judgment of the High Court the above civil appeals are preferred.

3. C.A. No. 4037 of 2002 is preferred by the Commission specifically contending that the Commission is not challenging the tariff fixed by the High Court in its appellate jurisdiction. It contends that it was aggrieved by the interpretation by the High Court of some of the provisions of the 1998 Act as also the High Court's finding in regard to the validity of the Regulations and the procedure to be followed in fixing the tariff which findings, according to the appellant, would make the Commission nugatory and defeat the very object of the 1998 Act.

4. C.A. No. 4047 of 2002 is filed by the Bharat Chamber of Commerce against the order made by the High Court dated 23.4.2002, whereby the High Court rejected the application filed by the appellant, seeking the refusal of the Judges from hearing the appeal on the ground of bias.

5. C.A. No. 4048 of 2002 is filed by the same appellant as in C.A. No. 4047/02, against an order made by the High Court on 7.5.2002, whereby the High Court declined to hear the arguments of the appellants on merits, on the ground that the said appellants were not entitled to the heard by the High Court, because of the objections raised by the said appellants attributing bias to the Judges.

6. C.A. No. 4049 of 2002 and other connected appeals are filed by the appellants who are aggrieved, not only by the order of their non impleadment, but also by the final order of the High Court dated 7-14/5/02, by which the High Court set aside the tariff fixed by the Commission and re-fixed and enhanced the tariff.

7. The first argument addressed on behalf of most of the appellants before us was in regard to bias. It was seriously contended on behalf of these appellants that the Learned Judges who constituted the Appellate Bench ought to have reused themselves from hearing the appeal, since the appellants had a reasonable apprehension of bias being entertained by those Judges who constituted the Bench. They also contended that their apprehension as to the bias of the Bench stands established from certain observations made in the impugned judgment of the High Court. The learned counsel representing the respondent company, have with equal vehemence opposed the argument of the appellants in regard to bias. Be that as it may, all parties before us have unanimously contended that the basic issues involved in these appeals would arise frequently not only between the parties to this case and in the Calcutta High Court, but also all over India and since as of now there is no authoritative pronouncement of this Court on the questions which arise in these appeals, therefore, we should finally decide these issues, whatever be our findings on the question of bias.

8. In this background, we have decided to consider the question of bias as the last question to be decide, that too, only if need be.

9. For deciding the issues that arise in these appeals, it is necessary to have a look at the various enactments which have direct bearing on these issues.

10. The Indian Electricity Act, 1910 (the 1910 Act), was enacted with a view to make an improvement on the then existing legislation controlling the generation, transmission and supply of electricity in this country. Out of the various provisions of this Act, we need only refer to Clause II of the Schedule to the 1910 Act, which read with Section 3(2)(f) of this Act, makes it obligatory for the licensee to follow the procedure as to the audit of the licensee's accounts which, inter alia, requires the same to be audited by such persons as the State Government may appoint or approve in that behalf. Thus, the 1910 Act has made the auditing of the accounts of a licensee a statutory requirement. This statutory requirement continues to operate inspite of subsequent enactments.

11. By the introduction of the 1948 Act, the legislature has sought to rationalise the provisions pertaining to supply of electricity and to take measures conducive to electrical development. While enacting the same, the legislature was of the opinion that within the framework of 1910 Act, it was not possible to have a coordinated development of electricity in India on a regional basis. Hence, it was necessary that the appropriate Government should be vested with the necessary legislative powers, to link together the supply and transmission of electricity to various parts of the country, by introducing a system known as the ""grid system"". With this view the 1948 system known as the ""grid system"". With this view the 1948 Act in Section 57 mandated that the provisions of Schedule VI shall be deemed to be incorporated in the licence of every licensee subject to the exception provided therein. Section 57A has provided for the constitution of a ""Rating Committee"" to oversee the procedure adopted by the licensee while fixing the tariff. Schedule VI to the 1948 Act lays down the principles to be followed in fixing the electricity tariff so far as the licensee is concerned. It is to be noticed herein that the said Schedule provides for self-assessment of the tariff by the licensee himself, following the principles laid down in the said Schedule. These are the principal Sections in the 1948 Act which have a bearing on the question of fixation of tariff by the licensee.

12. By the introduction of the 1998 Act, the Parliament brought about some important changes from that which was provided in the 1948 Act. It is seen from the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the 1998 Act that the Parliament noticed that there was lack of a rational retail tariff. It also noticed that among other defects there were high level cross subsidies, lack of power planning and operation, inadequate capacity, neglect of the consumer, limited involvement of the private sector's skill and resources and the absence of an independent regulatory authority.

13. Section 3 of the 1998 Act provides for the establishment and incorporation of a Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, while Section 17 of the said Act provides for a similar Commission for the State. This section provides that the State Commission should consist of not more than 3 members including the Chairperson. It also provides that the Chairperson and the members of the State Commission, among other things, shall be persons who have adequate knowledge of, and capacity in dealing which problems relating to engineering, finance, commerce, economics, law or management. These members of the State Commission are to be selected by a Selection Committee constituted by the State Government under Section 18 of this Act. The members of the said Selection Committee consists of, a person who has been a Judge of the High Court, the Chief Secretary of the State concerned and the Chairperson or a member of the Central Electricity Regulatory Authority. The said section also fixes a time schedule by which the vacancy in the office of the State Commission should be filed up. Section 19 of this Act provides for term of office and service conditions of the members of the State Commission, while Section 20 provides for a special procedure for the removal of members of the State commission which will have to be done by the Government on the ground of proved misbehavior, after the High Court on reference being made to it by the Governor, has reported that the member concerned ought to be removed on such ground of proved misbehavior. The qualification of the members of the State Commission as required under the Act, as also the method of their appointment and conditions of their service, including the protection given to them in reference to their removal and disqualification from holding subsequent office, clearly shows that the State Commission under the Act is constituted as a high power expert committee with autonomous authority and is expected to function independently.

14. Section 22 of the Act enumerates the functions of the Commission. The most important function to be noticed in this Section, at least so far as these appeals are concerned, is the power of the Commission to determine the tariff for electricity, be it wholesale, bulk, and grid or retail. This determination of tariff under the Act will have to be made in the manner provided in Section 29 of the said Act. Section 22(1)(d) obligates the Commission to promote competition, efficiency and economy in the activities of the electricity industries to achieve the objects and purposes of this Act.

15. Section 26 empowers the Commission to authorise any person as it deems fit to represent the interest of the consumer in all the proceedings before it.

16. Section 27 of the 1998 Act provides for an appeal to the High Court, by any person aggrieved by any decision or order of the State Commission. It lays down that no appeal or revision would lie to any other court.

17. Section 29 provides for determination of the tariff by the State Commission. Since the interpretation of this Section is a major bone of contention between the parties in these appeals, it is necessary for us to reproduce the same in its entirety.

""29. Determination of tariff by State Commission.--(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, the tariff for intra-State transmission of electricity and the tariff for supply of electricity, grid, wholesale, bulk or retail, as the case may be, in a State (hereinafter referred to as the ""tariff""), shall be subject to the provisions of this Act and the tariff shall be determined by the State Commission of that State in accordance with the provisions of this Act.

(2) The State Commission shall determine by regulations the terms and conditions for the fixation of tariff, and in doing so, shall be guided by the following, namely:-

(a) the principles and their applications provided in Sections 46, 57 and 57-A of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 (54 of 1948) and the Sixth Schedule thereto;

(b) in the case of the Board or its successor entities, the principles under Section 59 of The Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 (54 of 1948);

(c) that the tariff progressively reflects the cost of supply of electricity at an adequate and improving level of efficiency;

(d) the factors which would encourage efficiency, economical use of the resources, good performance, optimum investments, and other matters which the State Commission considers appropriate for the purposes of this Act;

(e) the interests of the consumers are safeguarded and at the same time, the consumers pay for the use of electricity in a reasonable manner based on the average cost of supply of energy;

(f) the electricity generation, transmission, distribution and supply are conducted on commercial principles;

(g) national power plans formulated by the Central Government.

(3) The State Commission, while determining the tariff under this Act, shall not show undue preference to any consumer of electricity, but may differentiate according to the consumer's load factor, power factor, total consumption of energy during any specified period or the time at which the supply is required or the geographical position of any area, the nature of supply and the purpose for which the supply is required.

(4) The holder of each licence and other persons including the Board or its successor body authorised to transmit, sell, distribute or supply electricity wholesale, bulk or retail, in the State shall observe the methodologies and procedures specified by the State Commission from time to time in calculating the expected revenue from charges which he is permitted to recover and in determining tariffs to collect those revenues.

(5) If the State Government requires the grant of any subsidy to any consumer or class of consumers in the tariff determined by the State Commission under this Section, the State Government shall pay the amount to compensate the person affected by the grant of subsidy in the manner the State Commission may direct, as a condition for the licensee or any other person concerned to implement the subsidy provided for by the State Government.

(6) Notwithstanding anything contained in Sections 57-A and 57-B of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 (54 of 1948 no rating committee shall be constituted after the date of commencement of this Act and the Commission shall secure that the licensees comply with the provisions of their licences regarding the charges for the sale of electricity both wholesale and retail and for connections and use of their assets or systems in accordance without the provisions of this Act.""

18. It is to be seen that this Section provides for the methodology to be followed by the Commission in determination of the tariff.

19. Section 37 of the Act requires the Commission to ensure transparency while exercising their powers and discharge of their functions.

20. Section 49 of the Act gives overriding effect over this Act to only two other enactments, namely, the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and the Atomic Energy Act, 1962. While Section 52 gives overriding effect to the provisions of the 1998 Act, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith, in any enactment other than this Act.

21. Section 57 empowers the State Government to make rules which will have to be notified in the Official Gazette.

22. Section 58 empowers the Commission to make Regulations, which also have to be notified in the Official Gazette and the Regulations have to be consistent with the Act and the Rules. Sub-section (2) of Section 58 in Clause (d), specifically provides that the Commission is empowered to make Regulations, providing for the manner in which charges for energy may be determined under Sub-section (2) of Section 29.

23. Section 59 obligates that the rules and regulations made under this Act have to be placed before the Houses of the Legislature. It is not in dispute that the rules framed by the State of West Bengal, as also the regulations framed by the State Commission have been placed before the legislature as required under Section 59 of the Act.

24. The State of West Bengal exercising the power under Section 57 of the 1998 Act enacted the West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission (Appointment of Chairperson and Members Functions, Budget and Annual Report) Rules, 1999 (hereinafter called the Rules). Rule 4 of the said Rules provides for the procedure to be adopted by the Commission in the proceedings before it. Sub-rule 1(SIC) of the said Rule mandates that before fixing the tariff, the Commission shall notify its intention in this behalf in leading newspapers of West Bengal and shall hold public hearing for the purposes.

25. In exercise of its power under Section 58 of the 1998 Act, the State Commission herein has framed the West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission (Conduct of Business) Regulations, 2000 (the Regulations). Regulation 18 thereof provides for the Commission to permit an association or other bodies corporate, or any group of consumers to participate in any proceeding before the Commission. It also empowers the Commission to control the nature and extent of participation of these groups before the Commission. Regulation 9 thereof provides for recognition of associations, groups, forums or body corporate or registered consumer associations for the purpose of representation before the Commission.

26. Regulation 24 provides for the coram at the meeting of the Commission. Regulation 30 provides for service of notices which in Sub-clause (d) includes the service of notice through publication in newspapers.

27. Regulation 31 and 32 provides for the manner in which the Commission could regulate the filing of the pleading as also the method of hearing.

28. Having noted the various salient features of the 1998 Act, we will now consider the manner in which the impugned tariff has been determined by the State Commission in the instant case.

29. The Commission while fixing the tariff for the years 2000-2001 and 2001-2002, called for objections/ representations from persons concerned, through newspaper publications. Pursuant to the same, it heard the Company, association or group of consumers in the proceedings before it. It had also appointed the Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI) as its Consultant.

30. The Commission before which the Company had filed its application for fixing of tariff for the year 2002-2003, did not entertain the said application, on the ground that the same was belated. But on the Company's application for the year 2000-01, the Commission after hearing the parties and taking into consideration other materials on record, including the report of the consultants, fixed the tariff for the said year @ Rs. 3.39 per unit, which is an increase of 1.15 per cent on the rate of tariff of the Company for the previous year. The Commission also fixed Rs. 3.41 per unit for the year 2001-2002. While so determining the tariff, the Commission followed the provisions of the 1998 Act and the regulations framed by it.

31. Being aggrieved by the said determination of tariff, the Company, as stated above, preferred the statutory appeal before the High Court, making the Commission alone the respondent. The High Court while rejecting the impleadment application of the appellant-organisations, proceeded to re-fix the tariff by only following the principles of Schedule VI to the 1948 Act and to the exclusion of other requirements of Section 29 of the 1998 Act. In the said process it re-fixed the average tariff for the year 2000-01 at Rs. 3.96 per unit and at Rs. 4 per unit for the year 2001-02. In the course of its judgment, the High Court also came to the conclusion that the regulations framed by the Commission, especially the ones pertaining to the right of the consumers to be heard in the proceedings, as also applications of the principles to be followed in determining the tariff, were contrary to law and directed in no uncertain terms that these regulations will have to be modified to bring them in conformity with its observations in the judgment, and further stated that failure to do so might result in the invocation of the High Court's power under the Contempt of Courts Act. In deciding the validity of the regulations, the High Court proceeded on the basis that while entertaining the power of appeal under Section 27 of the 1998 Act, it also has the power vested in it under Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India. It also held that the non-obstante clause found in Section 29 of the 1998 Act and the other overriding provisions found in the 1998 Act could not come in the way of the application of the VI Schedule to the 1948 Act alone, while determining the tariff by the Commission. On factual aspects, it reversed many of the findings of the Commission to which separate reference will be made by us when we take up those issues for consideration.

32. It is against this judgment of the High Court, various appeals have been filed.

33. In these appeals the appellants have questioned each and every finding of the High Court, both in regard to the interpretation of the provisions of the 1998 Act and the 1948 Act, as also the factual findings given by the High Court in regard to various heads of accounts either accepted or rejected by the High Court in the process of re-determining the tariff.

34. At one point of time we thought it appropriate to decide the legal issues pertaining to interpretation of the statutes alone and to remit the matter back to the Commission to reconsider the factual issues, to be determined by the Commission in the light of our findings on the legal issues. However, after hearing the parties at length, we thought that the ends of justice would be served if we could finally decide all the important issues arising in these appeals and thereafter to remit the matter to the Commission only, to apply those principles and recalculate the tariff on the basis of our findings and directions given in these appeals. It is in this light that we will now endeavour to settle the questions involved in these appeals.

Locus standi:

35. One of the important issues which arises for our consideration in these appeals is as to the locus standi of the consumers before the Commission in its proceedings, as also before the High Court in an appeal under Section 27 of the 1998 Act. The Commission in the proceedings before it, issued a newspaper publication calling upon the persons to appear and file objections in case they were interested in the proceedings before it. Pursuant to the said publication, it is stated that a number of organisations including some of the appellants herein, representing sections of the consumers, appeared and filed their objections and submitted their arguments which were taken note of by the Commission in the proceedings before it. This was not objected to by the respondent company. As noticed above, the respondent company being aggrieved by the final order of fixation of tariff by the Commission preferred the statutory appeal before the High Court. To the said appeal, may be for reasons of convenience, the respondent company impleaded only the Commission as a party respondent, but the High Court in the initial stage thought it appropriate to issue a public notification of the filing of the appeal and called upon the interested parties to represent themselves before it. Pursuant to the said publication, some of the organisations representing consumers sought impleadment before the High Court. However when the matter camp up for final hearing the applications of these consumer organisations were rejected by the High Court holding that the Commission does not have the power to issue indiscriminate notice to the consumers or for hearing them. It also held that the advertisements published in this regard as per the Commission's regulations as also the advertisements issued by the High Court in the appeal were all on an erroneous view that the 1998 Act envisages such procedures.

36. The question, therefore, for our consideration is whether the consumers have a legal right or not to be heard in the proceedings before the Commission under Section 29(2) of the 1998 Act, as also in an appeal under Section 27 of the said Act. The High Court in the course of its judgment has negatived this right to the consumers, primarily on the ground that permitting a large number of consumers who in the instant case are to the extent of 17 lacs would amount to an indiscriminate representation. It observed that permitting such large scale interference in the proceedings would lead to absurdity. It also held that normally a rate payer i snot heard before such a rate is fixed on the basis of public policy. In support of this conclusion, the High Court relied upon the procedure for fixing the rate of income-tax wherein a tax-payer had no such say in such fixation of the rate of income-tax. It also observed in the course of the judgment that the rates to be fixed cannot be opposed by consumers by observing as follows:

""...The rates of the consumers cannot be affected by a general public clamour of the sort, that the rates are too high, that the CESC accounts are in no way reliable, that they cannot be losing money, when they are earning so much. That, this organisation in Bombay, or that concern of the Tatas, is doing so much better, that in the same State in another area of supply, another Company is managing with such low rates; this sort general 'newspaper' objection has no place in any court of law or a Tribunal which does something to affect the legal rights and liabilities of Companies and citizens.""

37. Such objections according to the learned Judges are irrelevant for the purpose of granting a right of hearing to the consumers. While discussing this question, the High Court also came to the conclusion that since the procedure laid down in Schedule VI to the 1948 Act is the sole consideration for the purpose of fixation of tariff and Schedule VI not having contemplated any role to be played by the consumers, the same procedure should be followed even in regard to fixation of tariff under the 1998 Act, which would mean that the consumers have no say whatsoever in the fixation of tariff. The court also held that if at all any representation of the consumers is permissible, the same should be done only in accordance with Section 26, by the Commission recognising a particular consumer association to represent them. Even in this regard, the High Court expressed some doubt because an organisation chosen to represent the consumers by the Commission may not be acceptable to another section of the consumers and, therefore, in reality, such recognition of a particular organisation by the Commission would also be futile.

38. Learned counsel appearing for the appellants have very strenuously contended that this view of the High Court is wholly unsustainable. They contend that under the various provisions of the Act, rules and regulations, the Parliament either directly or by subordinate legislation has conferred the right of representation on the consumers and it is not open to the High Court to negative such statutory right. Though, learned counsel representing the respondent company had stated before the High Court that the company had no objection to the impleadment of the consumers either before the Commission or before the High Court, still tried to justify the finding of the High Court before us.

39. Having considered the finding of the High Court, we are of the opinion that though generally it is true that the price fixation is in the nature of a legislative action and no rule of natural justice is applicable, (See Shri Sitaram Sugar Company Ltd. and Anr. etc. v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0249/1990MANU/SC/0249/1990 : [1990]1SCR909 ), the said principle cannot be applied where the statute itself has provided a right of representation to the party concerned. therefore, it will be our endeavour to find out whether, as contended by learned counsel for the appellants, the statute has provided such a right to the consumers or not.

40. While considering his question, it is relevant to notice that so far as the 1948 Act is concerned, the consumers had no such specific right. But we notice that the 1998 Act brought about a substantial change in the manner in which the determination of tariff has to be made. It not only took away the right of the licensee or a utility to determine the tariff, but also conferred the said power on the Commission. This was done because one of the primary objects of the 1998 Act was to create an independent regulatory authority with the power of determining the tariff, bearing in mind the interests of the consumers whose rights were till then totally neglected. The fact that the Commission was obligated to bear in mind the interests of the consumers is also indicative of the fact that the Commission had to hear the consumers in regard to fixation of tariff. This right of the consumers is further supported by the language of Section 26 of the Act, which specifically mandates the Commission to authorise any person as it deems fit to represent the interest of the consumers in all proceedings before it. If the above provision of the Act is read in conjunction with Sections 22 and 29 read with Section 28(2)(d) of the Act 1998 Act, it is clear that the Commission while framing the regulations must keep in mind the interest of the consumers for the purpose of determining the tariff. At this stage, it may be worthwhile to notice the mandate of the Parliament in Section 37 of the 1998 Act to the Commission that the Commission should ensure transparency while exercising its powers and discharging its functions which also indicates that the proceedings of the Commission should be public which, in itself, shows participation by interested persons. That apart, the State of West Bengal in exercise of its power under Section 57 of the Act has enacted the West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission (Appointment of Chairperson and Members Functions, Budget and Annual Report) Rules, 1999. In the said rule under Rule 4(SIC) the State Government has provided that the Commission before taking any decision on the rates of tariff must notify its intention in this behalf, in leading newspapers of West Bengal and hold public hearing for the said purpose (emphasis supplied). Even the Commission under the power conferred on it in Section 58 of the Act, has framed the West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission (Conduct of Business) Regulations, 2000 as amended by Regulations dated 3.2.2000, wherein, under Regulation 18 the Commission, can permit an association or other body corporate or any group of consumers to participate in any proceedings before the Commission, on such terms and conditions, including, in regard to be nature and extent of participation as the Commission may consider appropriate. The Commission under Regulation 19 is also empowered to notify a procedure to association, groups, forums or body corporate or registered consumer associations, for the purpose of representation before the Commission. These Regulations also provide for the procedure for the filing of affidavits, pleadings, service of notice and the right of participation. Under Regulation 32 of the manner of hearing before the Commission is also provided for. These rules and regulations framed by the State Government and the Commission will have to be placed before the State legislature under Section 59 of the 1998 Act. Thus, these rules and regulations have the necessary statutory force. A combined reading of these provisions of the Act, rules and regulations, clearly shows that the statute has unequivocally provided a right of hearing/representation to the consumers, though the manner of exercise of such right is to be regulated by the Commission. This right of the consumer is neither indiscriminate nor unregulated as erroneously held by the High Court. It is true that in Calcutta the respondent company supplies energy to nearly 17 lacs consumers, but the statute does not give individual rights to every one of these consumers. The same is controlled by the Regulations. therefore, the question of indiscriminate hearing as held by the High Court will not arise. That apart, when a statute confers a right which is in conformity with the principles of natural justice, in our opinion, the same cannot be negatived by a court on an imaginary ground that there is a likelihood of an unmanageable hearing before the forum concerned. As noticed above, though normally price fixation is in the nature of a legislative function and the principles of natural justice are not normally applicable, in cases where such right is conferred under a statute, it becomes a vested right, compliance of which becomes mandatory. While the requirement of the principles of natural justice can be taken away by a statute, such a right when given under the statute cannot be taken away by courts on the ground of practical convenience, even if such inconvenience does in fact exist. In our opinion, statute having conferred a right on the consumer to be heard in the matter pertaining to determination of the tariff, the High Court was in error in denying that right to the consumers. Consequently, the right of the consumer of prefer an appeal under Section 27 of the 1998 Act to the High Court is similar, if they are in nay manner aggrieved by any order made by the Commission. Alternatively, if the company is an aggrieved party and if it prefers an appeal, then it has to make such of those consumers who have been heard by the Commission, as party respondent, and such consumers will have the right of audience before the appellate court.

In the instant case, none of the consumers/consumer organisations were allowed to participate in the proceedings by the Commission have been made"

1. In all these appeals the question of law which arises for determination is identical and even the Assessee is the same. However, it so happened that the same issue was considered by the Delhi Bench as well as West Regional Bench at Mumbai of the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal (for short, 'CEGAT') and they have given conflicting opinions. Insofar as Mumbai Bench of CEGAT is concerned, it has decided the issue in favour of the Assessee. However, the Delhi Bench, while taking a contrary view, which is in favour of the Revenue, has not agreed with the Mumbai Bench of CEGAT for the reasons mentioned therein, which shall be noted at the appropriate stage.

2. The issue relates to the eligibility for concessional rate of additional duty [also known as Counter Vailing Duty (CVD)] in terms of Notification No. 64/93-CE. The Assessee is in the business of tourism, which operates taxis to ferry the tourists from one place to another. Way back in the year 1995, it had imported Honda Accord cars and filed refund claim on the ground that it was eligible for concessional rate of CVD in terms of the aforesaid Notification. In this refund claim the Assessee sought refund of 10% of total CVD. The refund claim of the Assessee was rejected. Questioning the veracity of this decision of the Assistant Commissioner of Customs, Refund Department, Mumbai, as well as Delhi, the Assessee approached the Commissioner (Appeals) at both the places. The Commissioner (Appeals) in Mumbai allowed the appeal of the Assessee and granted the benefit of the aforesaid Notification with a direction to the lower authority to sanction the refund to the Assessee as claimed. Against this order, the Revenue preferred appeal before CEGAT. CEGAT, vide orders dated November 13, 2000 rejected the appeal of the Revenue. Against these orders, Revenue is in appeal.

3. On the other hand, in the proceedings emanating from the rejection of the refund by the Assistant Commissioner of Customs (Refund), New Delhi, the appeal of the Assessee was dismissed by the Commissioner of Customs (Appeals), New Delhi. This order of the Commissioner was challenged by the Assessee before CEGAT. The Delhi Bench of CEGAT, however, dismissed the appeal of the Assessee vide orders dated January 08, 2001. Against these orders it is the Assessee which has filed the appeals.

4. These are the reasons to hear all the appeals analogously as the question of law raised by the Revenue as well as the Assessee is common.

5. Before we advert to the view taken by the two respective Benches of CEGAT, it would be apposite to take stock of few facts which led to the controversy in issue, along with terms of Notification No. 64/93-CE dated February 28, 1993.

6. The admitted facts are that the Honda Accord cars imported by the Assessee were manufactured abroad. On the import of such cars, normally, CVD is payable @ 40%. This duty was paid by the Assessee at the time of clearance of the imported goods and refund of 10% was claimed seeking the benefit of Notification No. 64/93-CE. This Notification dated February 28, 1993 is reproduced below for the better appreciation of the dispute:

No. 64/93-C.E., dated 28.2.1993 as amended by No. 11/94-C.E. dated 1.3.1994: In exercise of the powers conferred by Sub-section (1) of Section 5A of the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944 (1 of 1944), the Central Government being satisfied that it is necessary in the public interest so to do, hereby exempts all goods falling under heading No. 87.03 of the Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 (5 of 1986) from so much of the duty of excise leviable thereon which is specified in the said Schedule as is in excess of the amount calculated at the rate of 40 per cent ad-valorem.

Provided that in a case where a saloon car after clearance has been registered for use solely as a taxi, the manufacturer of the said saloon car shall be entitled to a further exemption of duty of 10 percentage points subject to the following conditions, namely:

(i) the manufacture at the time of clearance of such saloon car has paid excise duty calculated at the rate of 40% ad valorem;

(ii) the manufacturer furnishes to the Assistant Collector of Central Excise a certificate from an officer authorised by the concerned State Transport Authority in this behalf to the effect that such saloon car has been for use solely as a taxi, within three months of the date of clearance of the said saloon car from the factory of manufacture or such extended period as the said Assistant Collector may allow;

(iii) the manufacturer had not collected from the person in whose name such saloon car has been registered as a taxi, or in a case had collected and has refunded to such person, the amount equivalent of such further exemption of duty, and

(iv) the manufacturer files a claim for refund of duty in terms of Section 11-B of Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944(1 of 1944).

7. What follows from the bare reading of the aforesaid Notification is that exemption from customs duty is provided in respect of goods falling under Heading 87.03 of the Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 (5 of 1986) (hereinafter referred to as the Tariff Act'), which is in excess of the amount calculated @ 40% ad valorem. Under Heading 87.03, various kinds of goods are mentioned. However, proviso to this Notification gives exemption of duty of 10% CVD in respect of particular goods, namely, saloon cars, if such saloon cars are used solely as taxis. It is subject to four conditions mentioned in the proviso.

8. Pertinently, this proviso mentions that the entitlement of further exemption of duty of 10% is admissible to 'the manufacturer of the said saloon car'. It is this expression used in the said proviso which is the bone of contention. According to the Revenue, only the manufacturer of the saloon car, which is imported and used solely as a taxi, is entitled to additional exemption of duty of 10% CVD, as the plain read of the provision manifestly suggests. The submission of the Assessee, on the other hand, is that for the purpose of this proviso, the importer, like the Assessee, is to be deemed as the manufacturer of the said saloon car. This is the short issue that needs determination.

9. Before adverting to the respective arguments of the learned Counsel for the Revenue as well as the Assessee, we deem it proper to state the reasons given by the two Benches of CEGAT, rendering opposite decisions. In fact, as we take notice of these orders, it would become apparent as to how the two Benches have perceived the language of the same Notification, in the light of the same judgments, differently, and that will obviate the necessity of taking note of the arguments of the counsel for the parties, and those are the respective arguments of the counsel for the parties.

10. The argument of the Assessee before the Mumbai Bench (or for that matter even before the Delhi Bench) was that the entire case had to be viewed from the philosophy behind the provisions of Section 3 of the Tariff Act, which was taken note of by the Apex Court in the case of Hyderabad Industries Ltd. and Anr. v. Union of India and Ors. (1699) 5 SCC 15 and Collector of Central Excise, Jaipur v. J.K. Synthetics MANU/SC/1487/1999MANU/SC/1487/1999 : (2000) 10 SCC 393, treating the importer as the manufacturer of such goods for the purpose of giving benefit of such Notification. Reliance was also placed on the judgment of this case in Thermax Private Limited v. Collector of Customs (Bombay), New Customs House MANU/SC/0209/1993MANU/SC/0209/1993 : (1992) 4 SCC 440. The Mumbai Bench of CEGAT relied upon and extracted from the judgment of this Court in Thermax Private Limited (supra) and accepted the plea of the Assessee thereby giving benefit of the Notification to the Assessee. The Delhi Bench, on the other hand, though took note of judgments in Thermax Private Limited (supra) and Hyderabad Industries Ltd. (supra), was of the opinion that those judgments did not apply to the facts of this present case. According to the Delhi Bench, the importer was to be treated as manufacturer only to the extent of granting the benefit of levying CVD @ 40% in terms of the Notification and the ratio of the said judgments could not be stretched to hold that the importer is to be treated as a manufacturer for the purpose of Notification No. 64/93-CE, which extends further concession of 10% only to the manufacturers.

11. From the aforesaid, it is clear that the entire case hinges upon the ratio laid down in Thermax Private Limited (supra) and followed in Hyderabad Industries Ltd. (supra) as well as in J.K. Synthetics (supra).

12. In Thermax Private Limited (supra), the facts were that the Assessee had imported goods described as ""Sanyo Single Effect Chiller"" from Japan for the purpose of using the same for refrigeration/air conditioning of two factories. The Assessee cleared the goods by paying customs duty as well as additional duty leviable Under Section 3(1) of the Tariff Act. The customs duty had been paid on the imported goods under customs tariff Item No. 84.17(1) at 40 per cent of the value of the imported goods plus a surcharge of 25 per cent thereon. The rate of additional duty had to be determined on the basis of Item 29-A(3) of the Central Excise Tariff and the basic excise duty payable thereon was at 80 per cent of the value of the goods under the above item read with Notification No. 42 of 1984/C.E. dated March 1, 1984. However, Notifications (No. 93 of 1976/CE and 63 of 1985/CE) provided a further concession of 25 per cent ad valorem provided conditions set out therein was fulfilled. There was no dispute that the Assessee was fulfilling other conditions contained in column (5) of the said Notification, one of which was that the Chiller imported by the Assessee was used in a factory-vide item (xiii). The Revenue, however, took the view that the second condition to claim a concession in CVD was not fulfilled, namely, the procedure specified in Chapter X of the Central Excise Rules, 1944 (for short, the 'Rules') was not followed. Chapter X of the Rules deals with remission of excise duty on goods used for special industrial purposes. Rule 192 in the said Chapter provides that benefit under this Chapter would be claimed by a manufacturer. The primary reason for rejection of concessional duty, therefore, was that the Assessee in the said case as importer of goods was not a manufacturer. In this context, the issue arose as to whether Assessee could be treated as a manufacturer for the purpose of availing the concession under the Rules. The Court answered the aforesaid question in the affirmative deeming the importer as the manufacturer to make him entitled to get the benefit of the said Notification.

13. The discussion in the judgment started with reference to Section 3(1) of the Tariff Act. As this provision applies in the present case as well, we take note of the same, which reads as under:

3. Levy of additional duty equal to excise duty.-(1) Any article which is imported into India shall, in addition, be liable to a duty (hereafter in this section referred to as the additional duty) equal to the excise duty for the time being leviable on a like article if produced or manufactured in India and if such excise duty on a like article is leviable at any percentage of its value, the additional duty to which the imported article shall be so liable shall be calculated at that percentage of the value of the imported article.

Explanation.-In this section, the expression 'the excise duty for the time being leviable on a like article if produced or manufactured in India' means the excise duty for the time being in force which would be leviable on a like article if produced or manufactured in India, or, if a like article is not so produced or manufactured, which would be leviable on the class or description of articles to which the imported article belongs and where such duty is leviable at different rates, the highest duty.

14. This Section deals with levy of additional duty, i.e. CVD, which is normally equal to the excise duty that is payable on a like article if produced or manufactured in India. However, it is a matter of common knowledge that Notifications of exemptions have been issued by the Excise Department from time to time Under Rule 8(1) of the Rules, in the case of imported goods, for determining the leviability of additional duty Under Section 3(1) of the Act. In that case, Notification No. 93/1976 was issued Under Rule 8 of the aforesaid Rules, which provides for a concession of 25% ad valorem, as already noted above. As per this Notification, one of the conditions to be fulfilled was that of procedure specified in Chapter X of the Rules. This Chapter provides for-'remission of (central excise) duty on goods used for special industrial purposes'. Rule 192, which appeared in this Section, relates to 'application for concession' and a reading of this Rule suggested that such application for concession under Chapter X could be filed by a manufacturer only. While holding that for the purpose of getting benefit of remission of CVD under the concession notification, the importer shall be treated as manufacturer. The Court gave the following rationale for holding so:

10....The benefit of Chapter X will no doubt generally be claimed by a manufacturer in which event he will have to make the application, get the licence and give the assurances, bond or guarantee required by the Rules but it can also be claimed by other persons. The language of the Rule applies to any person, not necessarily a manufacturer, wishing to obtain remission of duty sanctioned by a notification Under Rule 8 on excisable goods in a specified industrial process...

xxx

11. It will at once be seen that there is nothing in the scheme of the Rule which makes it inapplicable to an importer of goods. The Assessee here has imported the goods and is selling them for use in a factory, a use which qualifies for the concession under the Rule 8 notifications. The types of use specified in the concessions notified could be of any kind and, even in the notifications under our consideration, there are many and varied. In respect of items falling under serial Nos. 3 and 8, in particular, the actual users may be private individuals or authorities and need not necessarily be manufacturers using the goods in question in an ""industrial process"" in a narrow sense of that term. For instance, any computer room, hospital or factory purchasing parts of refrigerating and air-conditioning appliances and machinery for use in the computer room, hospital or factory would be entitled to claim the concession by following the prescribed procedure. Only, for claiming a concession in excise duty the user should be the manufacturer himself or he must have made the purchase from a manufacturer liable to pay excise duty on the item whereas in regard to a claim for CVD concession, the supplier will be an importer. The latter will be entitled to sell the goods at the concessional rate of duty (or at nil rate if there is an exemption) if the purchaser from him who puts the goods to the specified use (whether a manufacturer or not) fulfils the requirements of Rule 192. Since the concession Under Rule 192 turns only on the nature and use to which the goods are put by the user or purchaser thereof and on whether he has gone through the procedure outlined in Chapter X it would not be correct to deny it to a supplier of such goods on the ground that he is an importer and not a manufacturer. That aspect is provided for by Section 3(1) of C.T. Act which specifically mandates that the CVD will be equal to the excise duty for the time being leviable on a like article if produced or manufactured in India. In other words, we have to forget that the goods are imported, imagine that the importer had manufactured the goods in India and determine the amount of excise duty that he would have been called upon to pay in that event. Thus, if the person using the goods is entitled to the remission, the importer will be entitled to say that the CVD should only be the amount of concessional duty and, if he has paid more, will be entitled to ask for a refund. In our opinion, the Tribunal was in error in holding that the Assessees could not get a refund because the procedure of Chapter X of the Rules is inapplicable to importers as such.

(Emphasis supplied)

15. The ratio of the aforesaid judgment in Thermax Private Limited (supra) was relied upon by this Court in Hyderabad Industries Ltd. (supra) while interpreting Section 3(1) of the Tariff Act itself; albeit in somewhat different context. However, the manner in which the issue was dealt with lends support to the case of the Assessee herein. In that case the Court noted that Section 3(1) of the Tariff Act provides for levy of an additional duty. The duty is, in other words, in addition to the customs duty leviable Under Section 12 of the Customs Act read with Section 2 of the Tariff Act. The explanation to Section 3 has two limbs. The first limb clarifies that the duty chargeable Under Section 3(1) would be the excise duty for the time being leviable on a like article if produced or manufactured in India. The condition precedent for levy of additional duty thus contemplated by the explanation is that the article is produced or manufactured in India. The second limb to the explanation deals with the situation where 'a like article is not so produced or manufactured'. The use of the word 'so' implies that the production or manufacture referred to in the second limb is relatable to the use of that expression in the first limb which is of a like article being produced or manufactured in India. The words 'if produced or manufactured in India' do not mean that the like article should be actually produced or manufactured in India. As per the explanation if an imported article is one which has been manufactured or produced, then it must be presumed, for the purpose of Section 3(1), that such an article can likewise be manufactured or produced in India. For the purpose of attracting additional duty Under Section 3 on the import of a manufactured or produced article the actual manufacture or production of a like article in India is not necessary. For quantification of additional duty in such a case, it has to be imagined that the article imported had been manufactured or produced in India and then to see what amount of excise duty was leviable thereon.

It is thus clear from the reading of this judgment that the Court held that the levy Under Section 3 of the Tariff Act is in the nature of a countervailing duty and is with a view to levy additional duty on an import to counter balance the excise duty payable on a like article indigenously manufactured. The Court also adverted to the scope/effect of Section 3 of the Tariff Act, particularly the expression, ""Excise Duty for the time being leviable on a like article in produced in India"" and the explanation thereto. In this regard it observed as follows: (At Para 11 of the Report)

The words ""if produced or manufactured in India"" do not mean that the like article should be actually produced or manufactured in India. As per the explanation if an imported article is one which has been manufactured or produced then it must be presumed, for the purpose of Section 3(1), that such an article can likewise be manufactured or produced in India. For the purpose of attracting additional duty Under Section 3 on the import of a manufactured or produced article the actual manufacture or production of a like article in India is not necessary.

The Court further referred with approval to the rationale of the provision as laid down in Thermax case (supra) in the following terms: (At Para 11 of the Report)

...As observed by this Court in Thermax (P) Ltd. v. Collector of Customs (at SCC pp. 452-53, para 11) that Section 3(1) of the Customs Tariff Act:

specifically mandates that the CVD will be equal to the excise duty for the time being leviable on a like article if produced or manufactured in India. In other words, we have to forget that the goods are imported, imagine that the importer had manufactured the goods in India and determine the amount of excise duty that he would have been called upon to pay in that event.

To our mind the genesis of Section 3(1) of the Customs Tariff Act has been brought out in the aforesaid observations of this Court, namely, that for the purpose of saying what amount, if any, of additional duty is leviable Under Section 3(1) of the Customs Tariff Act, it has to be imagined that the articles imported had been manufactured or produced in India and then to see what amount of excise duty was leviable thereon.

This position has been reiterated in Motiram Tolaram v. Union of India MANU/SC/0466/1999MANU/SC/0466/1999 : (1999) 6 SCC 375, CCE v. J.K. Synthetics MANU/SC/1487/1999MANU/SC/1487/1999 : (2000) 10 SCC 393, Lohia Sheet Products v. Commr. of Customs MANU/SC/1121/2008MANU/SC/1121/2008 : (2008) 11 SCC 510 and Collector of Customs (Preventive) v. Malwa Industries Ltd. MANU/SC/0185/2009MANU/SC/0185/2009 : (2009) 12 SCC 735 In fact, in Lohia Sheets and Malwa Industries cased (supra), this Court was considering exemption notifications envisaging use of certain material within a ""factory"" and still held that an importer would be entitled to the benefit of the exemption notifications in view of Section 3 of the Tariff Act and the decisions in Hyderabad Industries and Thermal cases. As such, it is now settled that the rate of duty would be only that which an Indian manufacturer would pay under the Excise Act on a like Article. Therefore, the importer would be entitled to payment of concessional/reduced or nil rate of countervailing duty if any notification is issued providing exemption/remission of excise duty for a like article if produced/manufactured in India.

16. We may mention that in the case of Commissioner of Central Excise, New Delhi v. Hari Chand Shri Gopal and Ors. MANU/SC/0955/2010MANU/SC/0955/2010 : (2011) 1 SCC 236, a three Judge Bench of this Court had raised certain doubts on the correctness of the principle contained in Thermax Private Limited (supra) as well as in J.K. Synthetics (supra) and referred the matter to a larger Bench. Reference order is reported as MANU/SC/1316/2005MANU/SC/1316/2005 : (2005) 8 SCC 164. The Constitution Bench decided the said case, which is reported as MANU/SC/0955/2010MANU/SC/0955/2010 : (2011) 1 SCC 236. From the reading of para 39 to 41 of the said judgment it becomes clear that though these cases were held not applicable to the fact situation and were distinguished, the Court did not say that the aforesaid judgments were incorrectly decided. In fact, by distinguishing the ratio of the said cases, the Constitution Bench impliedly gave its imprimatur to the principle laid down in the aforesaid judgments.

17. We are of the opinion that since we are dealing with exemption notification issued Under Rule 8 of the Rules, which was the position in Thermax Private Limited (supra) as well, for the purpose of extending benefit of concession contained in Notification No. 64/93-CE, the principle in Thermax Private Limited (supra) would clearly become applicable. We may point out that a specific query was put to the learned Counsel for the Revenue to the effect that if the importer is not deemed as manufacturer for the purpose of applicability of the said notification, then there cannot be a situation where such benefit of this Notification would be extended to any person, inasmuch as, it was almost impossible to visualise a situation where a foreign manufacturer would import the saloon cars in this country and would utilise those cars for tourist taxis. Learned Counsel for the Revenue had no answer or reply to our query. It is obvious that the purpose of exemption Notification No. 64/93-CE was to extend benefits to the importers of saloon cars to use the said cars for tourist taxis. Going by the spirit and the objective behind this Notification, the irresistible conclusion would be to apply the principle of Thermax Private Limited (supra) in the present case as well.

18. We, accordingly, allow the appeal preferred by the Assessee and reverse the order of the Delhi Bench of CEGAT. On the other hand, the view of the Mumbai Bench of CEGAT is upheld thereby dismissing the appeals preferred by the Revenue. Outcome of these appeals would be that the Assessee shall be entitled to refund of 10% CVD paid by him.

No costs.

G.B. Pattanaik, J.

1. The appellant is a direct recruit to the Rajasthan Administrative Service, having been selected through the competitive examination held by the Rajasthan Public Service Commission. The recruitment of the appellant had been made on 5.6.1975 under the Rajasthan Administrative Service Rules 1954. The Government of Rajasthan finding necessity for making emergency recruitment to the State Administrative Service framed a set of Rules in the year 1956, called 'The Rajasthan Administrative Service (Emergency Recruitment) Rules 1956' and then another similar set of Rules have been framed in the year 1959, called 'The Rajasthan Administrative Service (Emergency Recruitment) Rules, 1959'. Emergency recruitment had taken place under the aforesaid two Emergency Recruitment Rules, once in the year 1956 and another in the year 1959. While the appellant has joined the Rajasthan Administrative Service on being recruited under the provisions of Rajasthan Administrative Service Rules of 1954 on 5. 6.1975, and is continuing, a set of Rules were framed by the Governor in exercise of power under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution on 29.9.1976, called 'The Rajasthan Administrative Service (Emergency Recruitment) Rules, 1976. The said Rules were amended on 15. 12.1976 (hereinafter referred to as 'The Emergency Recruitment Rules, 1976'). Persons on being selected under the provisions of the aforesaid Emergency Recruitment Rules of 1976 were appointed on 6. 11.1978. The validity of the Rules relating to seniority under the Emergency Recruitment Rules of 1956 as well as of 1959 were challenged in a Writ Petition and the learned Single Judge of Rajasthan High Court quashed the provision dealing with seniority in the aforesaid Emergency Recruitment Rules by judgment dated 4. 4.1980. Special appeals being filed by the State Government and the same were dismissed by the Division Bench on 14.8.1980. A seniority list was published by the State Government on 2.6.1980 and in the aforesaid list persons recruited under the Recruitment Rules of 1976 were shown as senior to the directly recruited officers to the Rajasthan Administrative Service in the year 1974 and 1976. A batch of Writ Petitions were filed by the direct recruits challenging the validity of Rule 25 of the Emergency Recruitment Rules 1976. On 12.6.1981 Rule 23 of the Emergency Recruitment Rules of 1956 and 1959 were amended and under the amended provision the emergency recruits would rank junior to the special recruits and senior to the direct recruits appointed during the same year. The batch of Writ Petitions including the Writ Petition filed by the appellant were dismissed by the learned Single Judge by judgment dated 7.1.1983. Special appeals were filed against the same to the Division Bench and the Division Bench by the impugned judgment dated 16.5.1997, having upheld the validity of Rule 25 of the Emergency Recruitment Rules of 1976 and having affirmed the judgment of the learned Single Judge the present appeal by grant of Special Leave has been filed. While upholding the validity of Rule 25 of the Emergency Recruitment Rules 1976, the learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench of Rajasthan High Court strongly relied upon the judgment of this Court in Anand .Parkash Saksena vs. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0357/1967MANU/SC/0357/1967 : (1969)ILLJ373SC and K.P. Singhal v. State of Rajasthan and Anr. MANU/SC/0562/1996MANU/SC/0562/1996 : AIR1996SC2218 . When this appeal has been placed before a Bench of this Court on 4.12.2001, a Bench of this Court examined the two decisions on which reliance has been placed and the fact that in Singhal's case (supra) this Court examined Rule 25 of the Emergency Recruitment Rules 1976 and held that the notional service could be taken into account as a part of service. It was further observed that it is no doubt true that the constitutional validity of Rule 25 (3)(1) and Rule 25(3)(2) of the Emergency Recruitment Rules of 1976 was not the subject matter of challenge, but having regard to the conclusions arrived at, by the earlier Bench decision of this Court of two learned judges it will be more appropriate that the appeal should be heard by a Bench of three learned Judges and that is how the matter has come before us.

2. Mr. Sushil Kumar Jain, appearing for the appellant contended that the persons recruited to the Rajasthan Administrative Service under the Emergency Recruitment Rules of 1976 and persons appointed to the cadre under the Recruitment Rules of 1954, all form only one class and, therefore, providing a special rule for seniority of those who were recruited under the Emergency Recruitment Rules of 1976 by having a notional year of allotment is discriminatory on the face of it and violates Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India and must be struck down. Alternatively, Mr. Jain argued that even if they form two different classes for the classification between them made under Rule 25, there has been no intelligible differentia and there is no nexus between providing a notional year of allotment for those who were recruited under the Emergency Recruitment Rules of 1976 with any specific object sought to be achieved and, therefore, Rule 25 of the Emergency Recruitment Rules, more particularly, the formula for giving a year of allotment must be struck down. According to Mr. Jain, Rule 25 of the Emergency Recruitment Rules, which provided that the year of allotment should be 1976 minus N1 plus half of N2 and both N1 and N2 being dependent upon the factor whether monthly emolument is Rs.625/- or less than Rs.625/-, there must be some rationale with the aforesaid fixation of emolument. But the Rules being totally silent and the Rule Making Authority having not indicated, the entire basis is imaginary and arbitrary and, therefore, the same must be struck down. Mr. Jain also urged that in the matter of determining the seniority, the period of practice or profession is given certain premium, depending upon the emoluments therefrom whether Rs.625/- or less than that. It is un-imaginable that such practice or profession has any relevance in the matter of administrative experience and consequently, the very basis is illogical and has to be struck down. According to Mr. Jain, when legislation is attacked, as being discriminatory, two conditions must be fulfilled to uphold the legislation namely (i) that the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons that are grouped together from other left out of the group and (ii) that the differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the legislation in question. According to Mr. Jain, the impugned provision contained in Rule 25 of the Emergency Recruitment Rules, does not satisfy either of the conditions. Referring to the preamble of the Emergency Recruitment Rules, Mr. Jain submitted that as more persons were immediately needed in Rajasthan Administrative Service, a Special Recruitment Rules had been framed and people from different walks of life were permitted to compete in the examination and get recruited. The standard of examination that had been fixed and the methodology of selection was undoubtedly different and, therefore, people with less merit could be taken in the service. Such people with inferior qualifications and their suitability having been tested with inferior standard, could not have been granted any premium for their past period during which period they did not have any administrative experience and adjudged from this stand point, the provisions of Rule 25 must be held to be grossly discriminatory and the High Court committed error in upholding the validity of the Rules.

3. At the outset, it may be stated that recruitment to Rajasthan Administrative Service through a special emergency recruitment and to have a statutory rule for such recruitment is not new to the State and in fact in almost every State, there has been such recruitment once or twice. The very purpose for having such an emergency recruitment is the urgent need to man the cadre of the administrative service and the insufficient number existing at a point of time. But it cannot be said that the process of selection, even for such emergency recruitment is either less competitive or the persons recruited are inefficient. It may be borne in mind that even in the Indian Administrative Service also, there has been an emergency recruitment.

4. In the Constitution itself, even while providing in Article 46 that the State shall promote the special care for the educational and economic interest of the weaker section of the people and in particular of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and Article 16(4) of the Constitution having further provided that the mandate of Article 16(1) requiring equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office in the State does not prevent the State from making any provision for the reservation of appointments to posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which in the opinion of the State is not adequately represented in the services of the State. Article 335 stipulates that the claims of the members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes shall be taken into consideration , consistent with the maintenance of efficiency of administration, in the making of appointment to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the union or of State. It is, thus, apparent that even in the matter of reservation in favour of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes the founding fathers of the Constitution did make a provision relating to the maintenance of efficiency of administration. In this view of the matter, if any statutory provision provides for a recruitment of a candidate without bearing in mind the maintenance of efficiency of administration such a provision cannot be sustained being against the constitutional mandate. But we are unable to accede to the contention of Mr. Jain that those persons who got recruited to the Rajasthan Administrative Service under the Emergency Recruitment Rules are either in-efficient or their suitability has been adjudged on an inferior standard. It may be reiterated that those persons also had undertaken a written test on specified subjects as indicated in the Rules and after qualifying in the written test they were also subjected to interview conducted by the Public Service Commission, in the same manner, as those who had been recruited to Rajasthan Administrative Service under the Recruitment Rules of 1954 though there may have been a variance on the subjects of which they had taken the test. But that by itself would not be sufficient to hold that the candidates recruited under the Emergency Recruitment Rules are less efficient or their suitability had been adjudged at a lesser standard. We would, therefore, reject the submissions made by Mr. Jain on the ground of discrimination, on the score.

5. Article 14 of the Constitution secures equal protection to government servants and Article 16 is a particular application of general guarantee provided in Article 14. The doctrine of equality before law is a necessary corollary to concept of rule of law accepted by the Constitution. It is well settled principle that if a person complains of unequal treatment, the burden squarely lies on that person to place before the court sufficient materials from which it can be inferred that there is unequal treatment. Where, however, the necessary materials have not been placed to show how there has been an unequal treatment, the plea of provisions being violative of Article 14 cannot be entertained. We record this conclusion of ours, as in course of hearing of this matter. Mr. Jain, learned counsel appearing for the appellant, had often repeated that the provision of the Emergency Recruitment Rules has permitted even a beetle shop owner with the minimum income as indicated therein to appear and compete at the test and on being selected, the period for which he had been earning the aforesaid amount could be taken into account for the purpose of seniority in the cadre even though there has been no nexus between that period and the service to which he has been recruited. Apart from making such submission on a hypothetical basis, no material has been produced to indicate if anyone of the persons recruited under the Emergency Recruitment Rules has reaped any undue advantage in respect of his past experience by adoption of the formula in the Emergency Recruitment Rules for the purpose of allotting year of allotment as 1976 -- (N 1 + N 2). In the absence of an iota of materials on this aspect, we are not required to examine the correctness of the said submission of Mr. Jain, on an. assumption that the provisions of the Recruitment Rules might have enabled the professionals on being recruited to count their past experience for reckoning their seniority in the cadre of Administrative Service even though the said experience might not have any co-relationship with the Administrative Service. Even otherwise, the entire experience of such recruits could not have been totally wiped off and, therefore, the rule-making authority while making the rules for recruitment on emergency basis did make the provisions contained in Rule 25 which is also in pari materia with similar provisions available elsewhere including the one which was meant for emergency recruitment to the Indian Administrative Service., Where the challenge is made to a statutory provision being discriminatory, allegations in writ petition must be specific, clear and unambiguous. There must be proper pleadings and averments in the substantive petition before the question of denial of equal protection of infringement of fundamental right can be decided. There is always a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of enactment and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there has been a clear transgression of the constitutional principles. The presumption of constitutionality stems from the wide power of classification which the Legislature must, of necessity possess in making laws operating differently as regards different groups of persons in order to give effect to policies. It must be presumed that the Legislature understands and correctly appreciates the need of its own people, that its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience. The claim of equal protection under Article 14, therefore, is examined with the aforesaid presumption that the State Acts are reasonable and justified. If we examine the challenge to the impugned provision from the aforesaid standpoint, we have no hesitation to hold that the appellants have utterly failed to establish any materials from which grievances about the discrimination alleged can be said to have been made.

6. The concept of equality before law does not involve the idea of absolute equality amongst all which May be a physical impossibility. All that. Article 14 guarantees is the similarity of treatment and not identical treatment. The protection of equal laws does not mean that all laws must be uniform. Equality before the law means that among equals the law should be equal and should be equally administered and that the likes should be treated alike. Equality before the law does not mean that things which are different shall be treated as though they were the same. It is true that Article 14 enjoins that the people similarly situated should be treated similarly but what amount of dissimilarity would make the people disentitle to be treated equally is rather a vexed question. A Legislature, which has to deal with diverse problems arising out of an infinite variety of human relations must of necessity, have the power of making special laws, to attain particular objects; and for that purpose it must have large powers of selection or classification of persons and things upon which such laws are to operate. Mere differentiation or inequality of treatment does not 'per se' amount to discrimination within the inhibition of the equal protection clause. The State has always the power to make classification on a basis of rational distinctions relevant to the particular subject to be dealt with. In order to pass the test of permissible classification, two conditions must be fulfilled, namely: (i) that the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others who are left out of the group, and (ii) that that differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act. What is necessary is that there must be a nexus between the basis of classification and the object of the Act. When a law is challenged as violative of Article 14, it is necessary in the first place to ascertain the policy underlying the statute and the object intended to be achieved by it. Having ascertained the policy and the object of the Act, the Court has to apply a dual test in examining the validity, the test being, whether the classification is rational and based upon an intelligible differentia which distinguished persons or things that are grouped together from others that are left out of the group, and whether the basis of differentiation has any rational nexus or relation with its avowed policy and objects. In order that a law may be struck down under this Article, the inequality must arise under the same piece of legislation or under the same set of laws which have to be treated together as one enactment. Inequality resulting from two different enactments made by two different authorities in relation to the same subject will not be liable to attack under Article 14. It is well settled that Article 14 does not require that the legislative classification should be scientifically or logically perfect. If we examine the impugned provisions of the Emergency Recruitment Rules from the aforesaid standpoint the conclusion is irresistible that the aforesaid set of Rules have been framed for a specific recruitment to the Administrative Service. The provision of Section 25 dealing with the seniority has been specifically designed to meet all situations under which people from different walks of life could be recruited to the Rajasthan Administrative Service under the Emergency Recruitment Rules. The lawmaking authority must be presumed to have examined pros and cons in making the aforesaid provision for seniority in the cadre which is in pari materia with similar provisions for recruitment to the Indian Administrative Service and, therefore, it is difficult for us to hold that the aforesaid provision is discriminatory in nature.

7. Emergency recruits to the Rajasthan Administrative Service form a class by themselves, they being neither direct recruits under, the Recruitment Rules of 1954, nor are they promotees. For the purpose of their seniority in the cadre, in the Emergency Recruitment Rules of 1976, a formula has been adopted. The said formula, in our opinion cannot be held to be discriminatory in nature. In fact In Anand Parkash Saksena v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0357/1967MANU/SC/0357/1967 : (1969)ILLJ373SC in somewhat similar circumstances, considering the validity of Regulation 3(3) of the Special Recruits Seniority Regulations, this Court held that since the Special recruits form a distinct class and the Regulation properly adopts the formula for fixing the seniority, the said Regulation cannot be held to be arbitrary or violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. The ratio in the aforesaid case should apply to the case in hand. We may also take note of the fact that provisions of the Emergency Recruitment Rules came up for consideration in the case of K.P. Singhal v. State of Rajasthan and Anr. MANU/SC/0562/1996MANU/SC/0562/1996 : AIR1996SC2218 . In that case interpretation of Sub-rule (3) of Rule 32 of the Rajasthan Administrative Service Rules, 1954, came up for consideration. The Court held that for the purpose of 20 years' service for being eligible to be appointed on the super-time scale under Sub-rule (3) of Rule 32, the notional service to which emergency recruits are entitled under Rule 25 of the 1976 Rules, should be added. In other words, the formula indicated in Rule 25, conferring a notional year of allotment to persons recruited under the Emergency Recruitment Rules, was very much before the Court and the Court held that the said notional service should be reckoned for computing the period of twenty years of service. It is true, as contended by Mr. Jain, that the validity of Rule 25 of the Emergency Recruitment Rules was not before the Court in the aforesaid case, but having examined the provisions and having expressed the view that the notional service to which the emergency recruits are entitled under Rule 25, should be added, it can be assumed that the Court has also upheld the validity of Rule 25. The aforesaid observation of this Court in the three-Judge Bench decision in Singhal's case, runs counter to the contention of Mr. Jain, for the appellant.

8. The contention of Mr. Jain that there is no nexus in the formula for fixation of seniority under Rule 25 of 1976 Rules with the object sought to be achieved though may not be thoroughly unsustainable, but in the absence of any materials establishing how the alleged discrimination has perpetrated we are not inclined to strike down the same, more particularly, when the persons for whose benefit the aforesaid Rules had been engrafted are a dying cadre, hardly few of them remaining in service, and that the Rule has operated upon for last quarter century. It is true, that the formula under Rule 25 confers benefit under the principle of N1 + N2 in relation to the conferment of year of allotment of the emergency recruits and it has not been demonstratively shown as to how the income has any nexus for the object sought to be achieved, but yet we think it inappropriate to strike down the Rules after it has operated for more than a quarter century on that score. A special formula fixing seniority of the emergency recruits other than that provided in the normal Rules had been thought of so that the entire past experience of such recruits is not totally wiped off. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the present case, and bearing in mind that hardly a few people of those emergency recruits are there in the cadre who are also on the verge of superannuation, we are not inclined to strike down the aforesaid Rule governing the seniority of the emergency recruits and thereby unsettle the matter of seniority in the cadre.

9. In course of hearing, we were also told that those who had joined the Rajasthan Administrative Service under the provisions of Emergency Recruitment Rules of 1976, have either superannuated or about to superannuate. Their seniority in the cadre as determined under Rule 25 of the Emergency Recruitment Rules has operated for all this period from 1976 onwards. In respect of a vanishing cadre, the seniority provision which has operated for more than 25 years, the same should not be altered after this length of time, as it would unsettle the entire seniority in the cadre. In the aforesaid premises, we do not find any justification for our interference with the impugned Judgment of the High Court.

10. The Civil Appeal fails and is dismissed.

P. Venkatarama Reddi, J.

1. A search was conducted by the officials of CBI on 25.03.1994 at the residential house of Shri Ashok Kumar Sinha an officer of the Telecom Department (hereinafter referred to as ""the complainant"") at Ranchi. This was followed by searches of the houses of his close relations and contractors at Patna and Ranchi. In between he was admitted to hospital on two occasions. On discharge from CCI Hospital at Ranchi on 3.4.1994. the petitioner was arrested ""with a view to interrogate him in custody"" and produced before the Court of Special Judge, CBI, Ranchi with a prayer to remand him to policy custody for 10 days. The Special Judge remanded him to judicial custody for a fortnight with a direction to the Jail Superintendent to get him medically examined and to submit the report. On receipt of the report of the Jail Superintendent, he was remanded to police custody for seven days and there was a further order to release him on provisional bail for one month from 13.4.1994. The Court also directed that he should be admitted in CCI Hospital and interrogated there. The provisional bail was confirmed later on subject to certain conditions. The CBI, after obtaining sanction, filed a charge sheet on 18.8.1998 under Sections 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act for the possession of assets disproportionate to the known sources of income.

2. A day thereafter, i.e. on 19.8.1998, the National Human Rights Commission (for short 'NHRC') received a complaint from Mr. A.K. Sinha alleging illegal detention from 25.3.1994 to 3.4.1994. He also alleged harassment and torture by the CBI officials including Mr. N.C. Dhoundial, S.P., CBI (Petitioner in WP (C) 42/2001). He alleged that a false case was registered against him for extraneous reasons on account of the antagonistic attitude of the S.P.--Mr. Dhoundial, towards him. The complainant alleged that the action of the CBI in causing his unlawful detention during the period 25.3.1994 to 3.4.1994 and the harsh treatment meted out to him aggravated his disease of cancer (which was detected later) and a major surgery had to be performed at Tata Memorial Cancer Hospital, Bombay to save his life. Seven officers of CBI were named in the complaint who, according to the complainant, were directly or indirectly responsible for his illegal detention. NHRC took cognizance of the complaint and called for a report from the Director, CBI. On consideration of the report, the learned Member of NHRC found that there was no substance in the complaint and that no action was called for. The learned Member observed that there was no truth in the allegation of harassment and denial of proper medical attention. It was also observed that the complainant never complained to the Court that he was being ill-treated by the CBI officers. The learned Member further observed that ""there was considerable force in the stand taken by the CBI that this complaint has been filed only to demoralize the CBI officers who are zealously investigating."" Proceedings to this effect were drawn up on 6.11.1998. The complainant then filed a petition on 21.9.1999 pointing out certain facts which according to him missed the attention of the NHRC while taking the decision recorded on 6.11.1998. The petitioner prayed for reopening the case and to take a fresh decision after giving him adequate opportunity to present his case.

3. The learned Chairman of NHRC, by his proceeding dated 10.3.2000 treated the petition filed by Shri A.K. Sinha as review petition and having found a prima facie case of illegal detention of the complainant by the CBI officials during the period 25.3.1994 to 3.4.1994, thought it fit to recall the findings recorded in the proceeding dated 6.11.1998 and to further proceed with the enquiry in the matter. Accordingly, show cause notices were issued to four CBI officials namely, Shri N.C. Dhoundial, Shri Narayan Jha, Shri P.K. Panigrahi and Shri B.N. Singh as to why appropriate recommendation should not be made to the Competent Authority for initiating disciplinary action and such other action as may be found expedient. On receipt of replies from the concerned officials of the CBI, the learned Chairman, by his proceeding dated 12.6.2000, rejected the version of the CBI officials, over-ruled the objections raised by them on points of law and held that the complainant was in de facto custody of the said officials without authority of law during the period 25.3.1994 to 3.4.1994 resulting in the violation of his human rights. The Commission directed the Director, CBI to initiate appropriate disciplinary action for the misconduct of the four officials arising out of the illegal detention of the complainant Shri A.K. Sinha. It was made clear that the direction would not in any manner affect the prosecution of Shri Sinha for the offences under Prevention of Corruption Act. It may be noted that before recording its findings and giving directions as above, the Commission did not afford personal hearing or the opportunity to adduce evidence to the writ petitioner and other officials.

4. Questioning the said order of NHRC, Shri P.K. Panigarhi, the then Inspector, CBI filed a Writ petition--CWJC 2454/2000 under Article 226 in the Patna High Court (Ranchi Bench). The learned Judge dismissed the writ petition by an order dated 14.8.2000. The learned Judge observed that all the contentions raised by the writ petitioner were considered by NHRC and he found no reason to interfere with the impugned order. However, the learned Judge made it clear that the order in question was in the nature of recommendation and disciplinary proceedings as and when initiated have to be disposed of independently on the basis of the evidence brought on record. Against this order in the Writ Petition Shri Panigrahi filed an appeal--LPA No. 309/2000 (R). By a speaking order dated 22.3.2001, the Division Bench admitted the appeal as the appeal raised important and debatable questions. Legal questions arising in the appeal were broadly indicated by the Division Bench. While ordering notice to NHRC, status-quo with respect to the appellant was directed to be maintained. Questioning this interim order passed pending the LPA, the complainant Shri A.K. Sinha filed SLP (C) No. 14392/2001. NHRC filed SLP (C) 8220/2001 against the same interim order.

5. Subsequent to the admission of LPA, two other CBI officials Shri Bishwanath Singh, the then SI, CBI and Shri N. Jha, the then Deputy SP, CBI also filed writ petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution. The learned Single Judge, following the interim order passed in LPA, granted an order of status-quo in regard to those writ petitioners also. It was further ordered that the Writ Applications shall be heard after the disposal of LPA. Assailing this order, the complainant A.K. Sinha filed SLP (c) Nos. 11182/2001 and 11186/2001. While so, Shri N.C. Dhoundial, the then SP, CBI, Ranchi had directly filed writ Petition (c) No. 42/2001. under Article 32 in this Court questioning the NHRC's order dated 12.6.2000. This Court directed issuance of notice on 15.1.2001. Thereafter, a bunch of transfer petitions, three by A.K. Sinha and three by NHRC came to be filed in this Court with a prayer to transfer the LPA and Writ Petitions to the file of this Court and to hear the same along with WP(C) No. 42 of 2001 filed by N.C. Dhoundial. The ground of transfer is that similar issues are involved for adjudication in the LPA/Writ Petitions pending in the High Court and the Writ Petition pending in this Court.

6. The SLPs, TPs and the Writ Petition have been grouped together and posted for final disposal. That is how these 11 matters are before us.

7. Before proceeding further, it is necessary to make a brief reference to the stand taken by the officials of CBI on the factual aspects relating to the alleged detention between 25.3.1994 to 3.4.1994 and the findings recorded by NHRC on this disputed issue.

8. The factual account given by the CBI officials is as follows:

After the search on 25.3.1994 the complainant was asked to accompany the DSP, CBI to the SP's office at Ranchi. During interrogation, the complainant disclosed that he kept certain papers, pass-books and keys of lockers in a brief case handed over to one Ranjan Pandey, a contractor of his department at Patna. He volunteered to accompany the CBI officials to Patna with a view to assist them in the investigation. Accordingly, Shri N. Jha, Shri Panigrahi and Shri B.N. Singh together with the complainant started on the journey to Patna in the evening. After reaching the outskirts of Ranchi. Sri Sinha complained of chest pain and wanted to be examined at a private nursing home named by him. Accordingly, he was taken to that hospital but the doctor concerned was not available. Hence, on the request of the complainant, he was taken to Central Coalfield Hospital at Ranchi and was admitted in the Hospital. The CBI officials left the hospital after his family members came to the hospital to attend on him. On the morning of 26.3.1994, he was discharged from the hospital after certain tests including ECG were conducted. The complainant then expressed his preparedness to go to Patna by air. He bought his own ticket and accompanied the CBI officers to Patna. On search of the house of Shri Ranjan Pandey at Patna, the brief case could not be found. However, certain papers were seized from his residence. Then the houses of the two close relatives of the complainant were searched till late night that day on the basis of the information furnished by him. On completion of the searches, the CBI officers stayed in the Coal India Guest House at Patna. The petitioner volunteered to stay with them that night on the ostensible ground that he felt embarrassed to stay with his relatives in the aftermath of the raids. On 27.3.1994, the flight to Ranchi was cancelled and there was some uncertainty in the time schedule of the trains brought for Ranchi on account of Holi festival the next day. Hence, the officials along with the complainant took a bus from Patna on the night of March 27th and reached Ranchi in the early morning hours of March 28th. The complainant was requested to attend the CBI office at Ranchi at 8.30 a.m. Accordingly, he came to the CBI office and in the course of questioning he disclosed that one more brief case with important documents was kept with another contractor. On a search of the said contractor's house, nothing incriminating was found, While returning to the CBI office, the petitioner again reported that he was not feeling well and requested that his father-in-law be informed. Accordingly, his father-in-law came to the CBI office and both of them left for CCI Hospital. His father-in-law got him admitted in the hospital and also deposited money for treatment. On 1.4.1994, even while the complainant was in hospital, he came to the CBI office with two brief cases said to have been kept with the two contractors. Those brief cases were seized in the presence of witnesses in the CBI office. The brief cases did not contain any incriminating material. The complainant without participating in further interrogation went back to the CCI Hospital. He was discharged from the CCI Hospital on 3.4.1994 at 12 noon and on the request of the IO went to the CBI office. As he did not cooperate with the investigating agency and did not even come forward to produce the documents relating to investments etc. admitted by him, it was decided to arrest and interrogate him in custody. That is why he was arrested on 3.4.1994 and produced before the Special Judge, CBI, Ranchi with a prayer to remand him to police custody.

9. The CBI officials denied having kept the police personnel in the hospital either on 25.3.1994 or on the second occasion. They relied on the entries in the case diary in support of their contention that he was not arrested till 3.4.1994. Regarding the steps taken by them for providing medical attendance to the complainant on the first day i.e. 25.3.1994, the stand of CBI officials has been that it was done on humanitarian considerations, but not because he was in their custody.

10 The Commission was not prepared to accept the version of the CBI officials. The relevant comment made by the learned Chairman of NHRC to discredit their version is extracted hereunder:

""The Commission has given its anxious consideration but it is not inclined to accept the above explanation because it is unreal to expect that a wrong doer will make a record of his wrong actions. Absence of such record in the case diaries prepared by a notice cannot be relied on to disprove the otherwise established fact of the illegal detention of Shri A.K. Sinha during the aforesaid period. Had Shri Sinha not been in actual custody of the CBI officers, there was no occasion for them to have provided him the medical aid and attention and to keep him under constant surveillance. More so, as per the officers' own showing, they were accompanying the petitioner from Ranchi to Patna and back for the purpose of making recoveries of certain incriminatory articles. The Commission, therefore, finds no substance in this objection of the notice officers and rejects the same.""

11. Thus the initiative taken by the CBI officers in joining him in the hospital when he complained of chest pain and the factum of complainant accompanying the CBI officials to Patna and coming back with them were relied, upon by the Commission to come to the conclusion that the complainant was in the actual custody of CBI officers. The Commission also observed that the complainant was under constant surveillance. Though it is not elaborated, the Commission probably meant that he was being watched while he was in hospital.

12. It is to be noted that the Commission did not afford personal hearing to the officials who were put on notice nor any opportunity of adducing evidence was afforded. The complaint was decided on the basis of averments in the review petition and the replies submitted by the officials concerned. The plea of the officials was tested broadly on the basis of probabilities and a conclusion was reached that the officials concerned were guilty of human rights violation.

13. The three legal objections raised by the CBI officials were over-ruled by the Commission. Firstly, it was held that by virtue of Section 13 of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, the power of review conferred on the civil court was available to the Commission. As the earlier order was not a decision on merits but merely an order abstaining from further enquiry the Commission felt that there was no bar to reconsider the entire issue in the interest of justice. The second objection based on Regulation 8(1)(b) of NHRC (Procedure Regulations) which bars complaints with regard to matters that are 'subjudice' was rejected with the observation that the question of violation of human rights as a result of alleged unauthorized detention of the complainant was not subjudice. The other important objection that the Commission is debarred from enquiring into the matter after the expiry of one year from the date on which the alleged illegal detention took place as per the mandate of Section 36(2) was answered by the Commission in the following words:

""The violation of human rights is a continuing wrong unless due reparation is made. It gives rise to recurring cause of action till redressal of the grievance. The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 has been enacted with the object of providing better protection of Human Rights and it cannot be assumed that the mere lapse of a certain period would be sufficient to render the violation immune from the remedy of redressal of the grievance.""

14. We cannot endorse the view of the Commission. The Commission which is an 'unique expert body' is, no doubt, entrusted with a very important function of protecting the human rights, but, it is needless to point out that the Commission has no unlimited jurisdiction nor does it exercise plenary powers in derogation of the statutory limitations. The Commission, which is the creature of statute, is bound by its provisions. Its duties and functions are defined and circumscribed by the Act. Of course, as any other statutory functionary, it undoubtedly has incidental or ancillary powers to effectively exercise its jurisdiction in respect of the powers confided to it but the Commission should necessarily act within the parameters prescribed by the Act creating it and the confines of jurisdiction vested in it by the Act. The Commission is one of the for which can redress the grievances arising out of the violations of human rights. Even if it is not in a position to take up the enquiry and to afford redressal on account of certain statutory fetters or handicaps, the aggrieved persons are not without other remedies. The assumption underlying the observation in the concluding passage extracted above proceeds on an incorrect premise that the person wronged by violation of human rights would be left without remedy if the Commission does not take up the matter.

15. Now, let us look at Section 36 of the Protection of Human Rights Act, which reads thus:

36. Matters not subject to jurisdiction of the Commission - ""(1) The Commission shall not inquire into any matter which is pending before a State Commission or any other Commission duly constituted under any law for the time being in force.

(2) The Commission or the State Commission shall not inquire into any matter after the expiry of one year from the date on which the act constituting violation of human rights is alleged to have been committed.""

Section 36(2) of the Act thus places an embargo against the Commission enquiring into any matter after expiry of one year from the date of the alleged act violative of human rights. The caption or the marginal heading to the Section indicates that it is a jurisdictional bar. Periods of limitation, though basically procedural in nature, can also operate as fetters on jurisdiction in certain situations. If an authority is needed for this proposition the observations of this Court in S.S. Gadgil v. Lal & Co.MANU/SC/0122/1964MANU/SC/0122/1964 : [1964]53ITR231(SC) may be recalled. Construing Section 34 of the Income Tax Act, 1922 the Court observed thus:

""Again the period prescribed by Section 34 for assessment is not a period of limitation. The section in terms imposes a fetter upon the power of the Income-tax Officer to bring to tax escaped income.""...

The language employed in the marginal heading is another indicator that it is a jurisdictional limitation. It is a settled rule of interpretation that the section heading or marginal note can be relied upon to clear any doubt or ambiguity in the interpretation of the provision and to discern the legislative intent (vide Uttam Das v. S.G.P.C.MANU/SC/0535/1996MANU/SC/0535/1996 : AIR1996SC2133 and Bhinka v. Charan Singh MANU/SC/0165/1959MANU/SC/0165/1959 : 1959CriLJ1223.

16. In fact, Section 36(2) does not mince the words and the language used is clear and categorical. The marginal note to the Section is being referred to only to consider whether the bar created by Section 36(2) has a bearing on the power or jurisdiction of the Commission.

17. The bar under Section 36(2) is sought to be got over by the Commission by invoking the theory of continuing wrong and the recurring cause of action. According to the Commission, every violation of human right is a continuing wrong until and unless due reparation is made. We find it difficult to accept this proposition propounded by the Commission. The short answer to this view point is that such a view, If accepted, makes Section 36(2) practically a dead letter. Moreover, going by the language employed in Section 36(2), we do not think that the concept of continuing wrong could at all be pressed into service in the instant case. The time limit prescribed is referable to the alleged 'act' constituting the violation of human rights. In a case like illegal detention, the offensive act must be deemed to have been committed when a person is placed under detention and it continues so long as the affected person remains under illegal detention. The commission of offensive act is complete at a particular point of time and it does not continue to be so even after the unauthorized detention ends. It is not in dispute that the complainant was produced before the Special Judge on 3.4.1994 and remand was obtained in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law. The alleged act of unauthorized detention which gives rise to violation of human rights ceased on 3.4.1994 and it does not perpetuate thereafter. It is not the effect of illegal detention which is contemplated by Section 36(2) but it is the illegal act itself. It would be a contradiction in terms to say that the arrest or detention beyond 3.4.1994 was in accordance with law and at the same time the arrest/detention continued to be wrongful. It cannot, therefore, be brought under the category of continuing wrong which is analogous to the expression 'continuing offence' in the field of criminal law. It cannot be said that the alleged wrongful act of detention repeats itself everyday even after the complainant was produced before the Magistrate and remand was obtained in accordance with law. Beyond 3.4.1994, there was no breach of obligation imposed by law either by means of positive or passive conduct of the alleged wrong-doers. To characterize it as a continuing wrong is, therefore, inappropriate. One year period for taking up the enquiry into the complaint, therefore, comes to an end by 3.4.1995. Just as in the case of Section 473 Cr.P.C., there is no provision in the Act to extend the period of limitation of one year. However, in the procedural Regulations framed by the Commission certain amount of discretion is reserved to the Commission. Regulation 8(1)(a) inter alia lays down that 'ordinarily' a complaint in regard to events which happened more than one year before the making of the complaint is not entertainable.

18. Irrespective of the validity of the prefacing expression 'ordinarily', let us examine the issue from the point of view of the regulation itself. The Regulation implies that if extraordinary circumstances exist, the complaint can be enquired into even after the expiry of one year. Are there any extraordinary circumstances made out in this case? We find none in the impugned order of the Commission aS already noticed, the petition filed by the complainant was received by the Commission a day after the charge sheet was filed though it bears an earlier date. For nearly 41/2 years the complainant kept quiet. The explanation given in the complaint for this long silence was that he was under the impression that by reporting the matter to NHRC he might be antagonizing the CBI officials, but, after realizing that they were not acting fairly and objectively and they continued to harass him, he thought of filing the petition before NHRC. The Commission, on its part, did not advert to this explanation which is really no explanation at all, nor did it advert to any extraordinary circumstances justifying interference after a long lapse of time prescribed by Section 36(2). The Commission thus tried to clutch at the jurisdiction by invoking the theory of continuing wrong which, as we held earlier, cannot be invoked at all. In this view of the matter, the direction given by the Commission to the Director of CBI, which has an undoubted effect on the service career of the writ petitioner, is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.

19. Before concluding our discussion on, this aspect, we would like to clarify in reiteration of what was said by this Court in Paramjit Kaur v. State of PunjabMANU/SC/0596/1998MANU/SC/0596/1998 : 1999CriLJ456 that in a case where the NHRC proceeds to investigate and inquire into the violation of human rights pursuant to the directions of this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution, the bar contained in Section 36(2) will not apply because in such an event, NHRC does not function under the provisions of the Act but as an 'expert body' aiding the Supreme Court in the discharge of its constitutional power under Article 32.

20. The question whether Section 13 of the Act empowers the Commission to exercise the power of review conferred on the Civil Court and if so, whether the conditions for the exercise of such power are satisfied, has been debated before us. In any case, whether the Commission has the power to reopen the closed complaint and enquire into the same in the absence of new material coming to light has also been debated. These questions need be gone into in view of our conclusion that the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction in taking up the enquiry in the face of the bar created by Section 36(2).

21. In the result, the order of NHRG dated 12.6.2000 is quashed and the writ petition (civil) No. 42 of 2001 stands allowed. The S.L.P. Nos. 8220 of 2001, 11182 of 2001, 11186 and 14392 of 2001 filed against the interim orders granted by the High Court are dismissed. All the Transfer Petitions are also dismissed with an observation that the High Court of Jharkhand may dispose of the related Writ Petitions/LPA pending on its file with expedition in the light of this judgment. No costs.

Rohinton Fali Nariman, J.

1. The present case involves the Court going through a dense jungle which consists of the U.P. Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings Act, 1960 [hereinafter referred to as ""the principal Act""] and three Amendment Acts made thereto. With the help of learned Counsel for both the sides, we have waded through the various Sections and Sub-sections of these Acts, only for the purpose of having to decide one basic question: as to whether ceiling proceedings in respect of the land in question have lapsed owing to Section 31 of the 1976 Amendment Act.

2. The brief facts necessary to decide the present case are as follows. A notice Under Section 10(2) of the principal Act, was served upon the tenure-holder, one Kamla Devi, to file objections against a proposal to declare 51.29 acres as surplus land. Pursuant to the said notice, objections were filed by the late Kamla Devi as also by Appellants 1 to 3, her legal heirs. According to the Appellants, on a correct construction of the Act, there was no surplus land. Meanwhile, the Prescribed Authority under the Act passed an order dated 13.1.1975 by which order the entire land that was the subject matter of the notice, was declared surplus. An appeal filed against the Prescribed Authority's order met with the same fate and was dismissed on 13.12.1987. It is important to note that an argument was raised that the proceedings had abated, which argument was answered by the Appellate Authority by saying that no fresh notice had been issued Under Section 9(2) of the Amendment Act and as this was so, the proceedings had not abated. A writ petition that was filed in 1987 was ultimately disposed of on 6.8.2007 where, by the judgment under appeal, the writ petition was dismissed. Several points were argued with which we are not at present concerned. The argument on abatement met the same fate as the judgment by the appellate authority.

3. Before adverting to the submissions of learned Counsel for both parties, it is first important to put the horse before the cart. A brief survey of the principal Act as well as the three Amendment Acts must now be undertaken.

4. The 1960 Act is an Act to provide for the imposition of ceiling on land holdings in the State of Uttar Pradesh. Under the principal Act, the ceiling area of a tenure-holder was said to be 40 acres of ""fair quality land"", and where the tenure-holder has a family consisting of more than 5 members, to the ceiling area of such tenure-holder is to be added 8 acres of fair quality land for every additional member of the family, subject to a maximum of 24 acres. ""Fair quality land"" was defined in the principal Act as meaning land, the hereditary rate of which is above Rs. 6/- per acre under the Act. A general notice was to be given to tenure-holders holding land in excess of the ceiling area so that they could submit a statement in respect thereof. A quasi-judicial determination is then to be made of surplus land, where objections are filed and the prescribed authority, after affording the parties a reasonable opportunity of being heard, and of producing evidence, is then to decide their objections after recording reasons, and then determine the extent of surplus land. An appeal is provided to the District Judge whose decision is then made final and conclusive. The prescribed authority is then to notify in the Official Gazette the surplus land so determined. On the date of such notification, such surplus land shall vest in the State free from all encumbrances, and on/from that date, all right, title and interest of all persons in such land shall stand extinguished. The principal Act then contains machinery for distribution of surplus land inter alia to cooperative societies of landless agricultural labourers. Compensation is given by the principal Act for vesting of surplus land of land-holders. With this prefaratory note, it is important now to set out the relevant Sections of the aforesaid Act.

Section 3. Definitions. In this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject of context-

(b) ""Fair Quality Land"" means land the hereditary rate whereof is above rupees six per acre;

Section 4. Ceiling area.

(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the ceiling area applicable to a tenure-holder shall be calculated after taking into account all the land in any holding in the state held by him, in his own right, whether in his own name or ostensibly in the name of any person.

(2) (a) The ceiling area of a tenure-holder shall be forty acres of Fair Quality Land.

(b) Where the tenure-holder has, or consists of, a family having more than five members, the ceiling area of such tenure-holder shall be the area mentioned in Clause (a) together with eight acres of Fair Quality Land for every additional member of the family subject to a maximum of twenty-four such acres:

Provided that, if at any time, the family comes to consist of not more than five members, all land held by the tenure-holder in excess of the ceiling area under Clause (a), shall become liable to be treated as surplus land.

Explanation-In calculating the ceiling area under this Sub-section in respect of land other than Fair Quality Land, one and one-half acre of such land, the hereditary rate whereof is above rupees four per acre, but does not exceed rupees six per acre, and two acres of such land the hereditary rate whereof is rupees four or less per acre, will be deemed to be equal to one acre of Fair Quality Land.

Section 5. Imposition of ceiling on existing land holdings.-

(1) As and from the date of enforcement of this Act, no tenure-holder shall, except as otherwise provided by this Act, be entitled to hold an area in excess of the ceiling area applicable to him, anything contained in any other law, custom, or usage for the time being in force, or agreement, to the contrary notwithstanding.

(2) In determining the ceiling area applicable to a tenure-holder at the commencement of this Act, any transfer or partition of land made after the twentieth day of August, 1959, which, but for the transfer or partition, would have been declared surplus land under the provisions of this Act, shall be ignored and not taken into account.

(3) The provisions of Sub-section (2) shall have no application to-

(a) a transfer in favour of the State Government;

(b) a partition under the U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953, or

(c) a partition of the holding of a Joint Hindu Family made by a suit or proceeding pending on twentieth day of August, 1959.

Section 9. General notice to tenure-holders holding land in excess of ceiling area for submission of statement in respect thereof.-As soon as may be, after the date of enforcement of this Act, the Prescribed Authority shall, by general notice, published in the Official Gazette, call upon every tenure-holder holding land in excess of the ceiling area applicable to him on the date of enforcement of this Act, to submit to him within 30 days of the date of publication of the notice, a statement in respect of all his holdings in such form and giving such particulars as may be prescribed. The statement shall also indicate the plot or plots for which he claims exemption and also those which he would like to retain as part of the ceiling area applicable to him under the provisions of this Act.

Section 12. Determination of the surplus land by the Prescribed Authority where an objection is filed.-(1) Where an objection has been filed under Sub-section (2) of Section 10 or under Sub-section (2) of Section 11, or because of any appellate order Under Section 13, the Prescribed Authority shall, after affording the parties reasonable opportunity of being heard and of producing evidence, decide the objections after recording his reasons, and determine the surplus land.

(2) Subject to any appellate order Under Section 13, the order of the Prescribed Authority under Sub-section (1) shall be final and conclusive and be not questioned in any court of law.

Section 13. Appeals-(1) Any party aggrieved by an order under Sub-section (2) of Section 11 or Section 12, may, within thirty days of the date of the order, prefer an appeal to the District Judge within whose jurisdiction the land or any part thereof is situate.

(2) The District Judge shall dispose of the appeal as expeditiously as possible and his decision thereon shall be final and conclusive and be not questioned in any court of law.

(3) Where an appeal is preferred under this section, the District Judge may stay enforcement of the order appealed against for such time and on such conditions as may be considered just and proper.

Section 14. Acquisition of surplus land.-(1) The Prescribed Authority shall-

(i) in case, where the order passed under Sub-section (1) of Section 11 has become final; or

(ii) in case, where no appeal has been preferred Under Section 13, after the expiry of the period of limitation provided therefor; or

(iii) in case, where an appeal has been preferred Under Section 13, after its decision;

notify in the Official Gazette the surplus land determined Under Sections 11, 12 or 13, as the case may be.

(2) As from the beginning of the date of the notification under Sub-section (1), all such surplus land shall stand transferred to and vest, except as hereinafter provided, in the State, free from all encumbrances and all rights, title and interests of all persons in such land shall, with effect from such date, stand extinguished.

(3) On the publication of the notification under Sub-section (1), any person claiming interest as a tenure-holder or a lessee in possession from the tenure-holder, in the surplus land in respect of which the notification has been published, may, within thirty days thereof, file an objection before the Prescribed Authority indicating the extent of his interest in such land.

(4) The Prescribed Authority shall, for reasons to be recorded in writing, dispose of the objections after affording to the objector, the tenure-holder concerned and the State Government, reasonable opportunity of being heard and of producing evidence.

(5) Any person aggrieved by an order under Sub-section (4) may, within thirty days of the date of the order, prefer an appeal to the District Judge in whose jurisdiction the land or any part thereof is situate. The order of the District Judge shall be final and conclusive and be not questioned in any Court of law.

(6) In disposing of an objection of an appeal under this section, the Prescribed Authority or the District Judge, as the case may be, shall accept any decision of a court of competent jurisdiction in respect of the rights of the parties.

(7) No person, other than a tenure-holder or a lessee of the tenure-holder whose right, title or interest in the surplus land has been recognized under the provisions hereinbefore contained, shall for purposes of this Act, be considered to have any right, title or interest in the surplus land.

(8) The Collector may, at any time, after the publication of the notification under Sub-section (1) and subject to any order passed under Sub-sections (4) and (5) take possession of the surplus land and may for that purpose use such force as may be necessary.

Section 27. Settlement of surplus land.

(1) The State Government shall settle out of the surplus land in a village in which no land is available for community purposes or in which the land as available is less than 15 acres with the Gaon Samaj of the village so however that the total land in the village available for community purposes after such settlement does not exceed 15 acres. The land so settled with the Gaon Samaj shall be used for planting trees, growing fodder or for such other community purposes, as may be prescribed.

(2) Subject to the provisions of Sub-section (1), where any surplus land had immediately preceding the date of vesting in the State under this Act, been held by a member of a co-operative society, such land may, if the society so desires, be settled by the State Government with the society.

(3) Any surplus Land remaining unsettled under the provisions of the preceding Sub-sections may be settled by the State Government:

(a) If the remaining land is less than 15 acres in the village, with a co-operative society of such tenure-holders, at least three-fourths of whom are holders of less than 3 1/8 acres of land each; and

(b) If the remaining land is more than 15 acres in the village, with a co-operative society of landless agricultural labourers so however that the total land allotted to such society, under this clause, if equally divided between all the members would give to each one not more than 3? acres of land.

(4) Any surplus land remaining after settlement under Clause (b) of Sub-section (3) may be settled by the State Government with any co-operative society no member whereof prior to such settlement holds more than 3? acres of land in his own right.

5. By an Amendment Act of 1972, being U.P. Act 18 of 1973, which came into force on 8.6.1973, a wholesale substitution of various Sections of the principal Act was carried out. This is for the simple reason that the erstwhile scheme of determining surplus ""fair quality land"" was now substituted by a scheme which determined surplus irrigated land. Even the ceiling limit of such land was changed to 7.3 hectares of irrigated land, plus a maximum of 6 hectares of additional land depending upon the size of the family. A new Section 13A was inserted conferring a power of review to the appellate authority under the Act. The transitory provision contained in Section 19 of the 1972 Amendment Act then provided for abatement of proceedings that were pending at the time of commencement of the Amendment Act, with a saving of proceedings that had already become final under the principal Act.

6. The relevant provisions of the U.P. Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings (Amendment) Act, 1972 are set out hereunder:

Section 3. Substitution of new Sections for Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of U.P. Act I of 1961. For Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the U.P. Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings Act, 1960, hereinafter referred to as the principal Act, the following Sections shall be substituted, namely:

...

4. Determination of area for purposes of ceiling and exemptions. For purposes of determining the ceiling area Under Section 5 or any exemption Under Section 6--

(i) Subject to the provisions of Clause (ii), one and one-half hectares of unirrigated land or two and a half hectares of grove-land or two and a half hectares of usar land shall count as one hectare of irrigated land;

(ii) two and a half hectares of any unirrigated land, in the following areas, namely-

(a) Bundelkhand;

(b) trans-Jamuna portions of Allahabad, Etawah, Mathura and Agra districts;

(c) cis-Jamuna portions of Allahabad, Fatehpur, Kanpur, Etawah, Mathura and Agra districts up to 16 kilometers from the deep stream of the Jamuna;

(d) the portion of Mirzapur district south of Kaimur Range;

(e) Tappa Upraudh and Tappa Chaurasi (Balai Pahar) of Tahsil Sadar in Mirzapur district;

(f) the portion of Tahsil Robertsganj, in Mirzapur district which lies north of Kaimur Range;

(g) Pargana Sakteshgarh and the villages mentioned in lists 'A' and 'B' of Schedule VI to the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950, in hilly patties of Parganas Ahraura and Bhagat of Tahsil Chunar in Mirzapur district; and

(h) the area comprised in the former Taluka of Naugarh or Tahsil Chakia in Varanasi district;

(i) hilly and Bhabar area of Kumaun and Garhwal Divisions and Jaunsar Bawar Pargana of Dehra Dun district;

shall count as one hectare of irrigated land.

5. Imposition of ceiling.

(1) On and from the commencement of the Uttar Pradesh Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings (Amendment) Act, 1972, no tenure-holder shall be entitled to hold in the aggregate, throughout Uttar Pradesh, any Land in excess of the ceiling area applicable to him.

xx

(3) Subject to the provisions of Sub-sections (4), (5) and (6), the ceiling area for purposes of Sub-section (1) shall be-

(a) In the case of a tenure-holder having a family of not more than five members, 7.30 hectares of irrigated land (including land held by other members of his family), plus two additional hectares of irrigated land or such additional land which together with the land held by him aggregates to two hectares, for each of his adult sons, who are either not themselves tenure-holders or who hold less than two hectares or irrigated land, subject to a maximum of six hectares of such additional land;

(b) In the case of a tenure-holder having family of more than five members, 7.30 hectares of irrigated land (including land held by other members of his family), besides, each of the members exceeding five and for each of his adult sons who are not themselves tenure-holders or who hold less than two hectares of irrigated land, two additional hectares of irrigated land or such additional land which together with the land held by such adult son aggregates to two hectares, subject to a maximum, of six hectares of such additional land.

Explanation-The expression 'adult son' in Clause (a) and (b) includes an adult son who is dead and had left surviving behind him minor sons or minor daughters (other than married daughters) who are not themselves tenure-holders or who hold land less than two hectares of irrigated land;

(c) In the case of a tenure-holder being a degree college imparting education in agriculture, 20 hectares of irrigated land;

(q) for purposes of service of notice Under Section 9.

Section 4. Amendment of Section 9.

Section 9, of the principal Act, shall be re-numbered as Sub-section (1) thereof, and after Sub-section (1) as so re-numbered, the following Sub-section shall be inserted, namely-

(2) As soon as may be after the enforcement of the Uttar Pradesh Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings (Amendment) Act, 1972, the prescribed authority shall, by like general notice, call upon every tenure-holder holding land in excess of the ceiling area applicable to him on the enforcement of the said Act, to submit to him within 30 days of publication of such notice, a statement referred to in Sub-section (1).

(3) Where the tenure-holder's wife holds any land which is liable to be aggrieved with the land held by the tenure-holder for purposes of determining of the ceiling areas, the tenure-holder shall, along with his statement referred to in Sub-section (1) also file the consent of his wife to the choice in respect of the plot or plots which they would like to retain as part of the ceiling areas applicable to them and where his wife's consent is not so obtained, the prescribed authority shall cause the notice under Sub-section (2) of Section 10 to be served on her separately.

Section 7. Insertion of new Section 13-A.

After Section 13 of the principal Act, the following Section shall be inserted, namely:

13-A. Re-determination of surplus land in certain cases.

(1) The prescribed authority may, at any time, within a period of two years from the date of the notification under Sub-section (1) of Section 14, rectify any mistake apparent on the face of the record:

Provided that no such rectification which has the effect of increasing the surplus land shall be made, unless the prescribed authority has given a notice to the tenure-holder of its intention to do so and has given him a reasonable opportunity of being heard.

(2) The provisions of Sections 10, 11, 12, 12-A, 13, 14 and 15 shall mutatis mutandis apply in relation to any proceeding under Sub-section (1), and for purposes of application of Section 10, the notice under the proviso to Sub-section (1), shall be deemed to be a notice Under Section 9.

(1) All proceedings for the determination of surplus land Under Section 9, Section 10, Section 11, Section 12, Section 13 or Section 30 of the principal Act, pending before any court or authority at the time of the commencement of this Act, shall abate and the prescribed authority shall start the proceedings for determination of the ceiling area under that Act afresh by issue of a notice under Sub-section (2) of Section 9 of that Act as inserted by this Act:

Provided that the ceiling area in such cases shall be determined in the following manner:

(a) Firstly, the ceiling area shall be determined in accordance with the principal Act, as it stood before its amendment by this Act;

(b) Thereafter, the ceiling area shall be re-determined in accordance with the provisions of the principal Act as amended by this Act.

(2) Notwithstanding, anything in Sub-section (1), any proceeding Under Section 14 or under Chapter III or Chapter IV of the principal Act, in respect of any tenure-holder in relation to whom the surplus land has been determined finally before the commencement of this Act, may be continued and concluded in accordance with the provisions of the principal Act, without prejudice to the applicability of the provisions of Sub-section (2) of Section 9 and Section 13-A of that Act, as inserted by this Act, in respect of such land.

7. On 17.1.1975, the U.P. Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings (Amendment) Act, 1974, being U.P. Act No. 2 of 1975, came into force. Interestingly, certain changes were made to the new legislative scheme contained in the 1972 Amendment. This Act, except for Sections 1 and 9, was brought into force with effect from 8.6.1973, which, as we have already seen, was the date of coming into force of the 1972 Amendment Act. This 1974 Amendment Act only added to the new substituted scheme the concept of ""single crop land"". The relevant provisions of this Act are set out hereinbelow:

Section 1. Short title and commencement.

(1) This Act may be called the Uttar Pradesh Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings (Amendment) Act, 1974.

(2) This Section and Section 9 shall come into force at once, and the remaining Sections shall be deemed to have come into force on June 8, 1973.

Section 4. Amendment of Section 4.

In Section 4 of the principal Act, in Clause (ii)

(a) For the words ""two and half hectares of any unirrigated land"", the words ""one and one-half hectares of single crop land or two and a half hectares of any other unirrigated land"", shall be substituted;

(b) At the end the following Explanation shall be inserted, namely:

Explanation-For the purposes of Clause (ii), the expression 'single crop land' means any unirrigated land capable of producing only one crop in an agricultural year, in consequence of assured irrigation from any State Irrigation Work or private irrigation work.

Section 9. Transitory Provision.

Where an order determining the surplus land in relation to a tenure-holder has been made under the principal Act, before the commencement of this Act, the prescribed authority may, at any time within a period of two years from the commencement of this Act, re-determine the surplus land in accordance with the principal Act as amended by this Act.

8. An Ordinance, which further amended the principal Act, came into force on the 10th day of October, 1975. After the said Ordinance lapsed, the third Amendment Act of 1976 was brought into force, being U.P. Act 20 of 1976, but with effect from the date of the Ordinance, namely, 10.10.1975. In this Amendment, various other changes were made with which we are not directly concerned, except that the fate of this appeal hinges on the correct construction of the transitory provision of this Act, namely, Section 31. The relevant Sections of this Amendment Act are set out hereunder:

Section 1. Short title and commencement.

(1) This Act may be called the Uttar Pradesh Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings (Amendment) Act, 1976.

(2) It shall be deemed to have come into force on October 10, 1975.

Section 8. Amendment of Section 9.

In Section 9 of the principal Act,-

(a) In Sub-section (2), the following proviso thereto shall be inserted namely:

Provided that at any time after October 10, 1975, the Prescribed Authority may by notice, call upon any tenure-holder holding land in excess of the ceiling area applicable to him on the said date, to submit to him within thirty days from the date of service of such notice a statement referred to in Sub-section (1) or any information pertaining thereto.;

(b) after Sub-section (2) the following Sub-section shall be inserted namely:

(a) held by him and the members of his family on January 24, 1971;

(b) acquired or disposed of by him or by members of his family between January 24, 1971 and October 10, 1975.

Section 11. Amendment of Section 14.

In Section 14 of the principal Act-

(a) for Sub-section (2), the following Sub-section shall be substituted, namely:

(2) As from the beginning of the date of the notification under Sub-section (1), all such surplus land shall stand transferred to and vest in the State Government free from all encumbrances and all rights, title and interests of all persons in such land shall, with effect from such date, stand extinguished:

Provided that the encumbrances, if any, shall be attached to the amount payable Under Section 17 in substitution for the surplus land.;

(b) Sub-section (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) shall be omitted;

(c) for Sub-section (8), the following Sub-section shall be substituted, namely:

Provided that a tenure-holder may, at any time voluntarily deliver possession to the Collector over the whole or any part of the land held by him which has been or is likely to be declared surplus under and in accordance with the provisions of this Act, and thereupon the provisions of Sub-section (2) shall apply to such land as they apply to any surplus land specified in a notification under Sub-section (1).

Section 31. Transitory Provisions.

(1) All proceedings under Sub-section (3) to (7) of Section 14 of the principal Act, as it stood immediately before the commencement of the Uttar Pradesh Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings (Amendment) Ordinance, 1976, pending before any Court or authority immediately before the date of such commencement shall be deemed to have abated on such date.

(2) Where an order determining the surplus land in relation to a tenure-holder has been made under the principal Act before January 17, 1975 and the Prescribed Authority is required to re-determine the surplus land Under Section 9 of the Uttar Pradesh Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings (Amendment) Act, 1974, then notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-section (2) of Section 19 of the Uttar Pradesh Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings (Amendment) Act, 1972, every appeal Under Section 13 of the principal Act or other proceedings in relation to such appeal, preferred against the said order, and pending immediately before the tenth day of October, 1975, shall be deemed to have abated on the said date.

(3) Where an order determining surplus land in relation to a tenure-holder has been made under the principal Act before the tenth day of October, 1975, the Prescribed Authority (as defined in the principal Act) may, at any time within a period of two years from the said date, re-determine the surplus land in accordance with the principal Act as amended by this Act, whether or not any appeal was filed against such order and notwithstanding any appeal (whether pending or decided) against the original order of determination of surplus land.

(4) The provisions of Section 13 of the principal Act shall mutatis mutandis apply to every order re-determining surplus land under Sub-section (3) of this Section or Section 9 of the Uttar Pradesh Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings (Amendment) Act, 1974:

Provided that the period of thirty days shall, in the case of an appeal against the order referred to in Section 9 of the Uttar Pradesh Imposition of Ceiling or Land Holdings (Amendment) Act, 1974, be computed from the date of such order or October 10, 1975, whichever is later.

(5) The provisions of Section 13-A of the principal Act shall mutatis mutandis apply to every re-determination of surplus land under the Section or Under Section 9 of the Uttar Pradesh Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings (Amendment) Act, 1974.

(6) Where any Assessment Roll has become final under Sub-section (4) of Section 21 before the sixteenth day of February, 1976, this same shall not be reopened, notwithstanding any amendment made in Chapter III of the principal Act read with the Schedule thereof by this Act.

9. Given this thicket of statutory law made by the legislature of U.P., we have heard learned Counsel on either side. Shri C.U. Singh, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the Appellants, has made several submissions before us, but ultimately submitted that on a correct construction of Section 31, the entire proceedings had abated, and that therefore the appellate authority which passed an order dated 13.12.1987 had no jurisdiction to do so. He argued that a conjoint reading of Sections 31(2) and 31(3) would show that as all the requisite conditions of these Sub-sections had been fulfilled, the appeal preferred Under Section 13 of the principal Act which was pending before the 10th day of October, 1975 shall be deemed to have abated on the said date. As no re-determination of surplus land was made in accordance with the principal Act as amended by the 1976 Amendment Act, according to learned Counsel, the period of two years having gone long ago and no re-determination having been made, the surplus land that is said to have been determined by the prescribed authority no longer has any legal sanctity. He made a faint argument that Under Section 19 of the 1972 amendment, proceedings had lapsed in any case, but we were not inclined to accept that argument inasmuch as a general notice Under Section 9 of the Amendment Act had been given to the tenure-holder which notice was not replied to by the said tenure-holder. This being the case, Section 19 of the 1972 Act obviously cannot apply.

10. Learned Senior Counsel also cited before us two judgments of this Court being State of Uttar Pradesh v. Mithilesh Kumari and Ors. 1987 (supp.) SCC 21, and Mansoor Ali Khan and Ors. v. State of U.P. and Ors. MANU/SC/0057/1992MANU/SC/0057/1992 : (1992) 1 SCC 737. However, since these judgments have no direct application to the facts of the present case, we do not consider it necessary to deal with them.

11. Shri Garg, on the other hand, vehemently argued on behalf of the State of U.P. that the conditions Under Section 31(2) not having been met, the said Section is inapplicable, and that being the case, the appellate authority correctly went ahead and heard the matter on merits and dismissed the appeal. His principal argument is that there are two conditions precedent to the applicability of Section 31(2) of the 1976 Amendment Act. First, there should be an order determining the surplus land which is made under the principal Act before 17.1.1975; and second, the prescribed authority must be required to re-determine surplus land Under Section 9 of the 1974 Amendment Act. In his submission the second pre-requisite is not met on the facts of the present case. This, he argued, is because Section 9 of the 1974 Amendment Act gave a discretion to the prescribed authority who ""may re-determine surplus land"" in accordance with the amendment made by the 1972 Amendment. According to learned Counsel, the occ"

1. Leave granted.

2. This criminal appeal by special leave is directed against the impugned judgment and order dated 08.12.2010 in Crl. Misc. No. 5777 of 2009 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Patna whereby it allowed the said criminal miscellaneous petition filed by the Respondent Nos. 2 to 9 herein, by setting aside the cognizance order dated 10.11.2008 passed by the learned Addl. Chief Judicial Magistrate, Rosera, Bihar in Singhia Police Case No. 37/2008 and quashed the criminal prosecution.

3. Brief facts of the case are stated hereunder to appreciate the rival legal contentions urged on behalf of the parties:

The case of the prosecution is that on 29.03.2008, the informant-Mukhtar went to the house of his relative at village-Navdega and stayed there. On 30.03.2008, at about 12.00 noon, his uncle Md. Hasim informed him on telephone that his wife's condition was serious and she was being taken to Singhia for treatment. Mukhtar was asked to reach Singhia. It is alleged by the informant that on reaching Singhia, he neither found his wife nor his uncle. On enquiry from his uncle, he was informed about the death of his wife. Thereafter, he reached his house and saw the dead body of his wife. His uncle disclosed him that his wife-Tamanna Khatoon (since deceased) had gone to maize field wherein she was found lying with her mouth and nose tied with her dupatta. She was spotted by one Hira Sada (PW-2), who was returning with her daughter. Upon hearing the noise made by the deceased she raised alarm and upon hearing the same informant's uncle-Md. Hasim along with others reached the spot and took Tamanna Khatoon to Singhia for treatment. She died on the way to Singhia. On 30.03.2008 FIR was lodged by Mukhtar, husband of the deceased against Md. Raju and Md. Halim @ Mangnu-Appellant No. 2 herein for the offences punishable Under Sections 302 and 120B read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code (for short ""Indian Penal Code"").

4. During investigation, many witnesses deposed before the Judicial Magistrate, Rosera Under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. wherein it has been alleged that Mukhtar, husband of the deceased has killed his wife.

5. On 30.09.2008 charge sheet No. 111/2008 in respect of FIR No. 37/2008 was filed in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM), Rosera by the police against Md. Hasim, Md. Noor Hasan, Md. Safique and Jhothi Sada.

6. After filing of the charge sheet, Mukhtar started threatening the witnesses. With a view to threaten the Appellant No. 1 on 17.10.2008, he reached his house with pistol and dagger. The Appellant No. 1 raised hue and cry and upon hearing the same, co-villagers caught Mukhtar with arms, after a chase. FIR No. 104/08 was registered against him for the offence punishable Under Sections 25 and 26 of the Arms Act, 1959 at Singhia Police Station.

7. On 31.10.2008, a supplementary charge sheet No. 126/2008, in respect of FIR No. 37/2008 was filed before the learned CJM by the police against Md. Mukhtar @ Munna, Md. Nazre Alam and Md. Farukh.

8. The learned CJM after considering the material placed before him vide order dated 10.11.2008. took cognizance Under Sections 302 and 120B read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code against Mukhtar and other accused-persons.

9. Aggrieved by the cognizance order passed by the learned CJM in PS Case No. 37/2008, Respondent Nos. 2 to 9 approached the High Court of Judicature at Patna by preferring Crl. Misc. No. 5777/2009 Under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing the order of learned CJM dated 10.11.2008.

10. The High Court by its order dated 08.12.2010 allowed the said petition by setting aside the cognizance order passed by the learned CJM and also quashed the criminal prosecution. Aggrieved by the said order, the Appellants herein, who are interested private parties, have filed this appeal urging various grounds.

11. Mr. Neeraj Shekhar, the learned Counsel for the Appellants contended that the High Court has failed to appreciate that the FIR and the charge sheet establish a prima-facie case against the Respondent Nos. 2-9. He submitted that when the allegations made against the accused person show a prima-facie case, criminal proceedings ought not to have been quashed by the High Court in exercise of its power Under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

12. It was further contended that the High Court has erred in setting aside the cognizance order passed by the learned CJM as the extraordinary or inherent powers do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction to act according to whim or caprice. He further submitted that the power of quashing criminal proceedings is to be exercised sparingly and with circumspection and that too in rarest of rare cases.

13. It was further contended by the learned Counsel that at the stage of taking cognizance of the offence it would not be proper, simply on the basis of material placed before the court by investigating agency, to determine whether a conviction is sustainable or not. The High Court has erred in appreciating the same by quashing the cognizance order passed by the learned CJM. He further submitted that the inherent power to quash the proceedings can be exercised only in a case where the material placed before the court does not disclose any offence or the allegations made therein are found frivolous, vexatious or oppressive. At this stage there should not be any meticulous analysis of the case, before the trial, to find out whether the case would end in conviction or acquittal.

14. It was further contended that in the instant case the charge sheet and FIR clearly establish the involvement and active participation of the accused-persons which the High Court has failed to appreciate.

15. It was further submitted by the learned Counsel that the Appellants have locus standi to maintain this appeal for the reason that the Appellants have connection with matter at hand as Appellant No. 1 was threatened by the informant-Mukhtar and Appellant No. 2 was falsely implicated by the informant-Mukhtar in the case of murder of his wife. Both the Appellants are aggrieved by the impugned order passed by the High Court setting aside the cognizance order passed by the Trial Court. In support of the aforesaid he placed reliance upon the Constitution Bench decision of this Court in the case of P.S.R. Sadhanantham v. Arunanchalam MANU/SC/0083/1980MANU/SC/0083/1980 : (1980) 3 SCC 141. He further placed reliance upon the decisions of this Court in Ramakant Rai v. Madan Rai and Ors. MANU/SC/0780/2003MANU/SC/0780/2003 : (2003) 12 SCC 395, Esher Singh v. State of A.P. MANU/SC/0223/2004MANU/SC/0223/2004 : (2004) 11 SCC 585, Ramakant Verma v. State of U.P. MANU/SC/8343/2008MANU/SC/8343/2008 : (2008) 17 SCC 257 and Ashish Chadha v. Asha Kumari and Ors. MANU/SC/1456/2011MANU/SC/1456/2011 : (2012) 1 SCC 680.

16. Per contra, Mr. Shivam Singh, the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondents contended that the answering Respondents have not been named in the FIR. The FIR in this case is based on the statement of Mukhtar against two persons, namely Md. Raju and Md. Halim for the murder of his wife and it was registered Under Sections 302 and 120B read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. He further submitted that on 11.04.2008, the informant-Mukhtar filed a protest petition before the learned CJM, Rosera. In the said protest petition it was brought to the notice of the court that originally he had given a written complaint to the police about the murder of his wife against five persons, namely Md. Raju, Md. Halim @ Mangnu, Khalid Gulab, Abu Quaiyum and Md. Amid Hussain for offences Under Sections 376, 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. However, the local police in collusion with the accused-persons dropped the names of three accused persons and also dropped charge Under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code against them knowingly and intentionally. The course of investigation was diverted in wrong direction to falsely implicate the Respondent Nos. 2-9.

17. It was further contended by the learned Counsel that the instant case is a unique case as the accused-persons are made prosecution witnesses and apart from them another set of tutored witnesses have been introduced in the case, who are not eye witnesses to the incident and have in their deposition Under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, before the Judicial Magistrate deposed that the informant-husband might have killed his wife. The High Court has rightly taken a very serious view of the whole matter and after proper scrutiny of the documents and material placed on record has come to an appropriate finding that the case against the Respondent Nos. 2-9 is merely based on suspicion and therefore, it has rightly quashed the proceedings against them.

18. He further submitted that after the incident Manjoor Alam father of the deceased in his statement before the police did not blame Mukhtar husband of the deceased for the murder of his daughter. As far as other Respondents are concerned, apart from the informant, they all are strangers to the matter and have been falsely implicated in this case by the local police at the behest of the real accused persons.

19. It was further submitted by the learned Counsel that the father and mother of the deceased have given their statement on a stamp paper before the Notary Public that their daughter was having a cordial matrimonial life with her husband and she was not being tortured by her husband or his family members in connection with any dowry demand.

20. By placing reliance upon the decision of this Court in J.K. International v. State (Govt. of Delhi) and Ors. MANU/SC/0126/2001MANU/SC/0126/2001 : (2001) 3 SCC 462 and HDFC Bank Ltd. and Anr. v. Nagpur District Security Guard Board and Anr. MANU/MH/1319/2007MANU/MH/1319/2007 : 2008 Cri. L.J. 995, it was further submitted by the learned Counsel that the Appellants have failed to disclose their bonafide connection with the cause of action, to be precise with the victim and thus, have no locus standi to maintain this appeal. Therefore, this appeal deserves to be dismissed on this score.

21. While concluding his contentions he submitted that the order passed by the High Court is a well reasoned order and the same does not suffer from any ambiguity. The decision of the High Court is also justified in the light of decision of this Court in the case of State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal MANU/SC/0115/1992MANU/SC/0115/1992 : 1992 Supp(1) SCC 335. Therefore, no interference of this Court is required in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.

22. After considering the rival legal contentions urged on behalf of both the parties, following issues would arise for our consideration:

1. Whether this appeal is maintainable by the Appellants on the ground of the locus standi?

2. Whether the High Court, in the instant case, has exceeded its jurisdiction while exercising its inherent power Under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure?

3. What order?

Answer to Point No. 1

23. The term 'locus standi' is a latin term, the general meaning of which is 'place of standing'. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary, 10th Edn., at page 834, defines the term 'locus standi' as the right or capacity to bring an action or to appear in a court. The traditional view of 'locus standi' has been that the person who is aggrieved or affected has the standing before the court, i.e., to say he only has a right to move the court for seeking justice. Later, this Court, with justice-oriented approach, relaxed the strict Rule with regard to 'locus standi', allowing any person from the society not related to the cause of action to approach the court seeking justice for those who could not approach themselves. Now turning our attention towards the criminal trial, which is conducted, largely, by following the procedure laid down in the Code of Criminal Procedure. Since, offence is considered to be a wrong committed against the society, the prosecution against the accused person is launched by the State. It is the duty of the State to get the culprit booked for the offence committed by him. The focal point, here, is that if the State fails in this regard and the party having bonafide connection with the cause of action, who is aggrieved by the order of the court cannot be left at the mercy of the State and without any option to approach the appellate court for seeking justice. In this regard, the Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of P.S.R. Sadhanantham's case (supra) has elaborately dealt with the aforesaid fact situation. The relevant paras 13, 14 and 25 of which read thus:

13. It is true that the strictest vigilance over abuse of the process of the court, especially at the expensively exalted level of the Supreme Court, should be maintained and ordinarily meddlesome bystanders should not be granted ""visa"". It is also true that in the criminal jurisdiction this strictness applies a fortiori since an adverse verdict from this Court may result in irretrievable injury to life or liberty.

14. Having said this, we must emphasise that we are living in times when many societal pollutants create new problems of unredressed grievance when the State becomes the sole repository for initiation of criminal action. Sometimes, pachydermic indifference of bureaucratic officials, at other times politicisation of higher functionaries may result in refusal to take a case to this Court Under Article 136 even though the justice of the lis may well justify it. While ""the criminal law should not be used as a weapon in personal vendettas between private individuals"", as Lord Shawcross once wrote, in the absence of an independent prosecution authority easily accessible to every citizen, a wider connotation of the expression ""standing"" is necessary for Article 136 to further its mission. There are jurisdictions in which private individuals--not the State alone--may it statute criminal proceedings. The Law Reforms Commission (Australia) in its Discussion Paper No. 4 on ""Access to Courts--I Standing: Public Interest Suits"" wrote:

The general rule, at the present time, is that anyone may commence proceedings and prosecute in the Magistrate court. The argument for retention of that right arises at either end of the spectrum--the great cases and the frequent petty cases. The great cases are those touching Government itself--a Watergate or a Poulson. However independent they may legally be any public official, police or prosecuting authority, must be subject to some government supervision and be dependent on Government funds; its officers will inevitably have personal links with government. They will be part of the 'establishment'. There may be cases where a decision not to prosecute a case having political ramifications will be seen, rightly or wrongly, as politically motivated. Accepting the possibility of occasional abuse the Commission sees merit in retaining some right of a citizen to ventilate such a matter in the courts.

Even the English System, as pointed by the Discussion Paper permits a private citizen to file an indictment. In our view the narrow limits set in vintage English Law, into the concept of person aggrieved and ""standing"" needs liberalisation in our democratic situation. In Dabholkar case this Court imparted such a wider meaning. The American Supreme Court relaxed the restrictive attitude towards ""standing"" in the famous case of Baker v. Carr. Lord Denning, in the notable case of the Attorney-General of the Gambia v. Pierra Sarr N'jie, spoke thus:

... the words ""person aggrieved"" are of wide import and should not be subjected to a restrictive interpretation. They do not include, of course, a mere busybody who is interfering in things which do not concern him;

Prof. S.A. de Smith takes the same view:

All developed legal systems have had to face the problem of adjusting conflicts between two aspects of the public interest--the desirability of encouraging individual citizens to participate actively in the enforcement of the law, and the undesirability of encouraging the professional litigant and the meddlesome interloper to invoke the jurisdiction of the courts in matters that do not concern him.

Prof. H.W.R. Wade strikes a similar note:

In other words, certiorari is not confined by a narrow conception of locus standi. It contains an element of the actio popularis. This is because it looks beyond the personal rights of the applicant; it is designed to keep the machinery of justice in proper working order by preventing inferior tribunals and public authorities from abusing their powers.

In Dabholkar case, one of us wrote in his separate opinion:

The possible apprehension that widening legal standing with a public connotation may unloose a flood of litigation which may overwhelm the Judges is misplaced because public resort to court to suppress public mischief is a tribute to the justice system.

This view is echoed by the Australian Law Reforms Commission.

25. In India also, the criminal law envisages the State as a prosecutor. Under the Code of Criminal Procedure, the machinery of the State is set in motion on information received by the police or on a complaint filed by a private person before a Magistrate. If the case proceeds to trial and the accused is acquitted, the right to appeal against the acquittal is closely circumscribed. Under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, the State was entitled to appeal to the High Court, and the complainant could do so only if granted special leave to appeal by the High Court. The right of appeal was not given to other interested persons. Under the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973, the right of appeal vested in the States has now been made subject to leave being granted to the State by the High Court. The complainant continues to be subject to the prerequisite condition that he must obtain special leave to appeal. The fetters so imposed on the right to appeal are prompted by the reluctance to expose a person, who has been acquitted by a competent court of a criminal charge, to the anxiety and tension of a further examination of the case, even though it is held by a superior court. The Law Commission of India gave anxious thought to this matter, and while noting that the Code recognised a few exceptions by way of permitting a person aggrieved to initiate proceedings in certain cases and permitting the complainant to appeal against an acquittal with special leave of the High Court, expressed itself against the general desirability to encourage appeals against acquittal. It referred to the common law jurisprudence obtaining in England and other countries where a limited right of appeal against acquittal was vested in the State and where the emphasis rested on the need to decide a point of law of general importance in the interests of the general administration and proper development of the criminal law. But simultaneously the Law Commission also noted that if the right to appeal against acquittal was retained and extended to a complainant the law should logically cover also cases not instituted on complaint. It observed:

Extreme cases of manifest injustice, where the Government fails to act, and the party aggrieved has a strong feeling that the matter requires further consideration, should not, in our view, be left to the mercy of the Government. To inspire and maintain confidence in the administration of justice, the limited right of appeal with leave given to a private party should be retained, and should embrace cases initiated on private complaint or otherwise at the instance of an aggrieved person.

However, when the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 was enacted the statute, as we have seen, confined the right to appeal, in the case of private parties to a complainant. This is, as it were, a material indication of the policy of the law.

(Emphasis supplied by this Court)

24. Further, this Court in the case of Ramakant Rai's case (supra) has held thus:

12. A doubt has been raised about the competence of a private party as distinguished from the State, to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court Under Article 136 of the Constitution of India, 1950 (in short ""the Constitution"") against a judgment of acquittal by the High Court. We do not see any substance in the doubt. The appellate power vested in this Court Under Article 136 of the Constitution is not to be confused with the ordinary appellate power exercised by appellate courts and Appellate Tribunals under specific statutes. It is a plenary power, ""exercisable outside the purview of ordinary law"" to meet the pressing demands of justice (see Durga Shankar Mehta v. Raghuraj Singh). Article 136 of the Constitution neither confers on anyone the right to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court nor inhibits anyone from invoking the Court's jurisdiction. The power is vested in this Court but the right to invoke the Court's jurisdiction is vested in no one. The exercise of the power of this Court is not circumscribed by any limitation as to who may invoke it. Where a judgment of acquittal by the High Court has led to a serious miscarriage of justice, this Court cannot refrain from doing its duty and abstain from interfering on the ground that a private party and not the State has invoked the Court's jurisdiction. We do not have slightest doubt that we can entertain appeals against judgments of acquittal by the High Court at the instance of interested private parties also. The circumstance that the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short ""the Code of Criminal Procedure"") does not provide for an appeal to the High Court against an order of acquittal by a subordinate court, at the instance of a private party, has no relevance to the question of the power of this Court Under Article 136. We may mention that in Mohan Lal v. Ajit Singh this Court interfered with a judgment of acquittal by the High Court at the instance of a private party. An apprehension was expressed that if appeals against judgments of acquittal at the instance of private parties are permitted there may be a flood of appeals. We do not share the apprehension. Appeals Under Article 136 of the Constitution are entertained by special leave granted by this Court, whether it is the State or a private party that invokes the jurisdiction of this Court, and special leave is not granted as a matter of course but only for good and sufficient reasons, on well-established practice of this Court.

In Esher Singh's case (supra), it has been held by this Court that Article 136 of the Constitution of India neither confers on anyone the right to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court nor inhibits anyone from invoking it. The relevant para 29 of the case reads thus:

29. A doubt has been raised in many cases about the competence of a private party as distinguished from the State, to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court Under Article 136 of the Constitution against a judgment of acquittal by the High Court. We do not see any substance in the doubt. The appellate power vested in this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution is not to be confused with ordinary appellate power exercised by appellate courts and appellate tribunals under specific statutes. It is a plenary power ""exercisable outside the purview of ordinary law"" to meet the pressing demands of justice. (See Durga Shankar Mehta v. Raghuraj Singh.) Article 136 of the Constitution neither confers on anyone the right to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court nor inhibits anyone from invoking the Court's jurisdiction. The power is vested in this Court but the right to invoke the Court's jurisdiction is vested in no one. The exercise of the power of this Court is not circumscribed by any limitation as to who may invoke it. Where a judgment of acquittal by the High Court has led to a serious miscarriage of justice, this Court cannot refrain from doing its duty and abstain from interfering on the ground that a private party and not the State has invoked the Court's jurisdiction. We do not have the slightest doubt that we can entertain appeals against judgments of acquittal by the High Court at the instance of interested private parties also. The circumstance that the Code does not provide for an appeal to the High Court against an order of acquittal by a subordinate court, at the instance of a private party, has no relevance to the question of the power of this Court Under Article 136. We may mention that in Mohan Lal v. Ajit Singh this Court interfered with a judgment of acquittal by the High Court at the instance of a private party. An apprehension was expressed that if appeals against judgments of acquittal at the instance of private parties are permitted, there may be a flood of appeals. We do not share the apprehension. Appeals Under Article 136 of the Constitution are entertained by special leave granted by this Court, whether it is the State or a private party that invokes the jurisdiction of this Court, and special leave is not granted as a matter of course but only for good and sufficient reasons, well established by the practice of this Court.

(Emphasis supplied by this Court)

Further, in Rama Kant Verma's case (supra) this Court has reiterated the aforesaid view that the appellate power of this Court Under Article 136 of the Constitution of India is not just an ordinary appellate power exercised by appellate courts and appellate tribunals under specific statutes. It is a plenary power which can be exercised outside the purview of ordinary law to meet the ends of justice. The relevant para 16 of the case reads thus:

16. In Ramakant Rai v. Madan Rai it was inter alia observed as follows: (SCC p. 402, para 12)

12. A doubt has been raised about the competence of a private party as distinguished from the State, to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court Under Article 136 of the Constitution of India, 1950 (in short 'the Constitution') against a judgment of acquittal by the High Court. We do not see any substance in the doubt. The appellate power vested in this Court Under Article 136 of the Constitution is not to be confused with the ordinary appellate power exercised by appellate courts and Appellate Tribunals under specific statutes. It is a plenary power, 'exercisable outside the purview of ordinary law' to meet the pressing demands of justice (see Durga Shankar Mehta v. Thakur Raghuraj Singh). Article 136 of the Constitution neither confers on anyone the right to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court nor inhibits anyone from invoking the Court's jurisdiction. The power is vested in this Court but the right to invoke the Court's jurisdiction is vested in no one. The exercise of the power of this Court is not circumscribed by any limitation as to who may invoke it. Where a judgment of acquittal by the High Court has led to a serious miscarriage of justice, this Court cannot refrain from doing its duty and abstain from interfering on the ground that a private party and not the State has invoked the Court's jurisdiction.

25. After considering the case law relied upon by the learned Counsel for the Appellants as well as the Respondents, in the light of the material placed on record, we are of the view that the Appellants have locus standi to maintain this appeal. From the material placed on record, it is clear that the Appellants have precise connection with the matter at hand and thus, have locus to maintain this appeal. The learned Counsel for the Appellants has rightly placed reliance upon the Constitution Bench judgment of this Court, namely, P.S.R. Sadhanantham (supra) and other decisions of this Court in Ramakant Rai, Esher Singh, Ramakant Verma (supra). Further, it is pertinent here to observe that it may not be possible to strictly enumerate as to who all will have locus to maintain an appeal before this Court invoking Article 136 of the Constitution of India, it depends upon the factual matrix of each case, as each case has its unique set of facts. It is clear from the aforementioned case law that the Court should be liberal in allowing any third party, having bonafide connection with the matter, to maintain the appeal with a view to advance substantial justice. However, this power of allowing a third party to maintain an appeal should be exercised with due care and caution. Persons, unconnected with the matter under consideration or having personal grievance against the accused should be checked. A strict vigilance is required to be maintained in this regard.

Answer to Point No. 2

26. A careful reading of the material placed on record reveals that the learned CJM took cognizance of the offences alleged against the accused-persons after a perusal of case diary, chargesheet and other material placed before the court. The cognizance was taken, as a prima facie case was made out against the accused-persons. It is well settled that at the stage of taking cognizance, the court should not get into the merits of the case made out by the police, in the chargesheet filed by them, with a view to calculate the success rate of prosecution in that particular case. At this stage, the court's duty is limited to the extent of finding out whether from the material placed before it, offence alleged therein against the accused is made out or not with a view to proceed further with the case. The proposition of law relating to Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been elaborately dealt with by this Court in Bhajan Lal's case (supra). The relevant paras 102 and 103 of which read thus:

102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant provisions of the Code under Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this Court in a series of decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power Under Article 226 or the inherent powers Under Section 482 of the Code which we have extracted and reproduced above, we give the following categories of cases by way of illustration wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should be exercised.

(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused.

(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investigation by police officers Under Section 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.

(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against the accused.

(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated Under Section 155(2) of the Code.

(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on th"

1. The petitioner is a former judge of Madras High Court. He was appointed on 25.01.1979 and superannuated on 07.12.1981. In the meanwhile, by a notification dated 29.07.1981, he was appointed as Commission of Inquiry to inquire into the incidents which took place in Coimbatore Town on 23.07.1981 arising from attacks on the office premises of two Tamil newspapers 'Dinakaran' and 'Malai Murasu'. In the aforementioned notification dated 29.07.1981 it was stated:

""I am directed to say that the President requests Shri Justice P. Venugopal, Judge, Madras High Court to function as the Commission of Inquiry under the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 in respect of the incidents that took place in Coimbatore Town in Tamil Nadu on 23rd July, 1981.

2. The time spent by Shri Justice P. Venugopal in the performance of the said functions will count as ""Actual Service"" within the meaning of paragraph 11(b)(i) of Part ""D"" of the Second Schedule to the Constitution of India read with Section 2(1)(c)(i) of the High Court Judges (Conditions of Service) Act, 1954. Shri Justice Venugopal will not be entitled to any extra remuneration for the above work except travelling allowances and daily allowances as admissible under the High Court Judges (Travelling Allowance) Rule, 1956""

2. Pursuant to or in furtherance of the said order dated 29.07.1981, the Government of Tamil Nadu also issued an order on 01.08.1981 appointing the petitioner as a Commission of Inquiry, terms of reference whereof are as under:

""(i) to enquire into the alleged incidents of attack on the offices and premises of the news papers 'Dinakaran' and 'Malai Murasu' in Coimbatore Town on 23rd July, 1981; and

(ii) to determine the persons who actually took part in such alleged incidents of attack on the said offices and premises.""

3. the petitioner despite his superannuation as a High Court Judge continued to occupy the post of Commission of Inquiry, where for the Government of Madras (as the State was thence known) issued an order dated 28.12.1981 stating:

""Justice P. Venugopal (Retired) who has been appointed as the Commission of Inquiry on a full time basis will draw the total emoluments last drawn by him as a Judge of the High Court, minus the pension to which he is eligible, excluding the pension commuted, if any, for the period he functions as the Commission of Inquiry.""

(Emphasis supplied)

4. Yet again he was appointed by the Government of Madras as a One Man Commission of Inquiry in relation to communal riots which took place in the District of Kanyakumari by an order dated 22.03.1982.

5. He was appointed as an ad hoc Judge for a term of one year in 1982 and yet again for another term of one year from 19.08.1983. After he demitted his office as an ad hoc Judge of the Madras High Court, he submitted his reports on 21.09.1985 and 30.04.1987. Hew was appointed as the Commissioner of Payment under the Madras Race Club (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertaking) Act, 1986 by an order dated 01.08.1986, which post he held till 31.12.1988.

6. The petitioner was allowed pension as a High court Judge for holding office for two years ten months and fourteen days.

7. He in the year 2001 filed a writ petition before the Madras High Court claiming, inter alia, for re-fixation of his pension upon taking into account the purported period of services from 01.08.1981 to 31.12.1988. The said writ petition by reason of the impugned judgment has been dismissed by the Madras High Court. This is how the petitioner is before us.

8. A short question which arises for consideration in this matter is as to whether the pension of the petitioner can be refixed keeping in view the fact that he held different offices from 01.08.1981 to 31.12.1988.

9. Article 217(1) of the Constitution of India provides for appointment of a Judge of the High Court. The age of superannuation for a Judge of the High Court ins 62 years. Constitution of India in terms of Article 224A provides for appointment of an ad hoc Judge in the following terms:

""22A. Appointment of retired Judges at sittings of High Courts - Notwithstanding anything in this Chapter, the Chief Justice of a High Court for any State may at any time, with the previous consent of the President, request any person who has held the office of Judge of that court or of any other High Court to sit and act as a Judge of the High Court for that State, and every such person so requested shall, while so sitting and acting, be entitled to such allowances as the President may by order determine and have all the jurisdiction, powers and privileges of, but shall not otherwise be deemed to be, a Judge of that High Court. ""

(Emphasis supplied)

10. An ad hoc Judge, thus, in terms of the aforementioned provision is only entitled to such allowances as the President may by order determine. A legal fiction, however, has been created therein in terms whereof he is not to be treated as a Judge of the High Court except for the purpose of exercising his jurisdiction, powers and privileges. An ad hoc Judge is appointed for reasons specified in the notification issued by the president of India in this behalf. An ad hoc Judge does not become a part of the High Court. If an ad hoc Judge is not considered to be a Judge of the High Court in terms of the legal fiction created, the question of computing his pension for the period he is appointed as an ad hoc Judge would not arise inasmuch a person is not entitled to any further pensionary benefits after he demits the constitutional office which he holds in terms of Article 217 of the Constitution. The claim of the petitioner that the period during which he was appointed as an ad hoc Judge should also be considered for the purpose of computing his pensionary benefits is, thus, without any substance.

11. The sole question which survives for consideration is as to whether the period during which he served as Commission of Inquiry or as Commissioner of Payments under the Madras Race Club (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertaking) Act, 1986 can be taken into consideration for computing the pensionary benefits. As noticed, the petitioner in terms of the notification of the Government of Madras dated 28.12.1981 was to receive the emoluments drawn by him as High Court Judge minus the pension to which he was eligible. Pension to a retired Judge is payable in terms of Article 221 of the Constitution of India. Sub-clause (iii) of Clause (3) of Article 112 of the Constitution of India provides that the pension payable to or in respect of Judges of any High Court which exercised jurisdiction in relation to any area included in the territory of India or which at any time before the commencement of this Constitution exercises jurisdiction in relation to any area included in a Governor's Province of the Dominion of India, shall be charged to the consolidated fund of India. What is charged to the consolidated fund of India is envisaged in Clause (2) of Article 221 of the Constitution of India, which in turn would mean that pension would be payable to a Judge for the period during which he rendered his services as a High Court Judge i.e. before attaining the age of 62 years.

12. It is at this juncture profitable to refer to Section 14, 15 and 16 of the High Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1954 (hereinafter referred to as 'the said Act'):

""14. Subject to the provisions of this Act, every Judge on his retirement, be paid a pension in accordance with the scale and provisions in Part I of the first Schedule.

Provided that no such pension shall be payable to a Judge unless:

(a) he has completed not less than twelve years of service for pension; or

(b) he has attained the age of sixty two years, and in the case of a Judge holding office on the 5th day of October, 1963, sixty years, or

(c) his retirement is medically certified to be necessitated by ill-health.

Provided further that if a Judge at the time of his appointment is in receipt of a pension other than a disability or wound pension in respect of any previous service in the union or a State, the pension payable under this Act shall be in lieu of and nor in addition to, that pension.

15. Eve Judge

(i) (a) who is a member of the Indian Civil Service shall on his retirement, be paid a pension in accordance with the scale and provisions in Part II of the first schedule;

(b) who is not a member of the Indian Civil Service but has held any other pensionable civil post under the Union or a State, shall on his retirement, be paid pension in accordance with the scale and provisions in Part III of the first schedule;

Provided that every such Judge shall elect to receive the pension payable to him either under Part I or Part III of the first schedule, and the pension payable to him shall be calculated accordingly.

(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-section (1) any Judge to whom that sub-section applied and who is in service on or after the 1st day of October, 1974, may if he has elected under the proviso to that sub-section to receive the pension payable to him under Part II or, as the case may be, part III of the first schedule before the date on which the High Court Judges (Conditions of Service) Amendment Act, 1976, receives the assent of the President cancel such election and elect afresh to receive the pension payable to him under Part I of the first Schedule and any such Judge who dies before the date of such assent shall be deemed to have elected afresh to be governed by the provisions of the said Part I, if the provision of that part are more favourable in his case.

16. The President of India for special reasons direct that any period not exceeding three months shall be added to the service for pension of a Judge.

Provided that the period so added shall be disregarded in calculating any additional pension under Part-I or Part II or Part III of the First Schedule.""

13. The First Schedule appended to the said Act lays down the manner in which the amount of pension shall be calculated in respect of a person who has retired as a High Court Judge depending upon the source from which he has appointed. By reason of notification dated 01.01.1996, Rule 9 of Part 1 of the First Schedule, the minimum pension payable to a retired Judge of the High Court was fixed Rs. 51,000/- per annum which reads thus:

""Where a Judge to whom this part applies retires or has retired at any time after the 26th January, 1950, without being eligible for a pension under any other provisions of this part, then notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing provisions, a pension of Rs. 51,000/- per annum shall be payable to such a Judge.

Provided that nothing in this paragraph shall apply:-

(a) to an additional Judge or acting Judge; or

(b) to a Judge who at the time of his appointment is in receipt of a pension (other than a disability or wound pension) in respect of any previous service under the Union or a State.""

14. The aforementioned provision, thus, does not apply to an additional or acting Judge. Evidently the same would not apply to the case of an ad hoc Judge.

15. Rule 8 of Part 1 of the Schedule appended to 1954 Act provides that a sum of Rs. 180,000/- per annum shall be payable to a Judge as a pension who has completed 14 years of service including not less than six years of service as Chief Justice of one or more High Courts. Subject to the aforementioned provision, the rate of pension which is payable to others is as under:-

""Subject to the other provisions of this part, the pension payable to a Judge to whom this part applies and who has completed not less than seven years of service for pension shall be:

(a) for service as Chief Justice in any High Court Rs. 14,630/- per annum for each completed year of service;

(b) for service as any other Judge in any High Court Rs. 11,150/- per annum for each completed year of service, provided that the pension shall in no case exceed Rs. 1,80,000/- per annum in the case of a Chief Justice and Rs. 1,56,000/- per annum in the case of any other Judge.""

16. The provisions of law mentioned hereinbefore are absolutely clear and unambiguous. A High Court Judge is entitled to pensionary benefits only in terms of the said Act and not otherwise. The said Act is a self contained Code. It does not contemplate grant of pension to a retired High court Judge for holding any other office of profit. Clubbing of services for the purpose of computation of pension is not contemplated under the said Act and, thus, the court cannot by process of interpretation of statutory or constitutional provisions hold so.

17. Mr. Jayant Bhushan, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner, however, would submit that in Justice Nand Lal Ganguly v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors. (Civil Misc. Writ Petition No. 18496 of 1999) MANU/UP/0679/1999MANU/UP/0679/1999 : 1999(4)AWC2985 , a Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court following the decision of this Court in Union of India and Ors. v. Pratibha Bonnerjea and Anr. MANU/SC/0181/1996MANU/SC/0181/1996 : AIR1996SC693 held that when a High Court Judge is appointed as Vice-Chairman of the Central Administrative Tribunal, the period during which such service is rendered, is to be tagged during which he held the office of a High Court Judge.

18. Pratibha Bonnerjea (supra) was decided by a two-Judge Bench of this Court. In that case interpretation of Rule 15-A of the Central Administrative Tribunal (Salaries and Allowances and Conditions and Service of Chairman, Vice-Chairman and Members) Rules, 1985 fell for consideration of this Court which is in the following terms:

""15-A. Notwithstanding anything contained in Rules 4 to 15 of the said Rules, the conditions of service and other perquisites available to the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Central Administrative Tribunal shall be the same as admissible to a serving Judge of a High Court as contained in the High Court Judges (Conditions of Service) Act, 1954 and High Court Judges (Travelling Allowances) Rules, 1956""

19. The question which was posed for consideration therein was as to whether a High Court Judge who was enjoying a pension as such can be said to be a person holding a pensionable post under the Union or a State at the time when one retires from the post of Vice-Chairman of the Central Administrative Tribunal. It was observed:

"".....If she was holding a pensionable post under the Union/State, there can be no doubt that she would not be entitled to pension under Part I but would be entitled to pension under Part III of the First Schedule. That gives rise to the question whether a High Court Judge who is drawing pension can be said to be a person holding a pensionable post under the Union/State. If the answer is in the affirmative the first respondent would be entitled to pension under Part III, but if the answer is in the negative, she would be entitled to pension under Part I of the First Schedule to the Act. That is the moot question for consideration under Rule 15-A, extracted earlier. The pension has to be the same as admissible to ""a serving Judge of a High Court under the Act and the Rules made thereunder""

3. Does a Judge of the High Court hold a post under the Union or a State? If yes, the first respondent having retired as a Judge of the High Court and having been drawing pension at all material times would not be entitled to fixation of pension under Part I of the First Schedule. If, however, it is found that a High Court Judge does not hold a post under the Union or a State, Part I would squarely be attracted as he or she would be outside the scope of Part III. Therefore, what we have to determine is whether the first respondent who was admittedly a pensioner as a retired High Court Judge could be said to be a person holding a pensionable post under the Union or a State.""

20. Ahmadi, CJ, speaking for the Bench in the aforementioned situation opined that as, a Judge of the High Court is not a Government servant but holder of a constitutional post and, thus, Part III of the First Schedule of 1954 Act would not be applicable. Having regard to the constitutional scheme, it was held in Pratibha Bonnerjea's (supra) that Part I of the Schedule appended to 1954 Act would be applicable and not Part III thereof. Although the said case was decided on its own facts, the attention of the court was not drawn to an earlier decision of this Court in Union of India v. K.B. Khare and Ors. MANU/SC/0151/1995MANU/SC/0151/1995 : (1995)IILLJ370SC , wherein the issue in question directly arose for consideration. Upon taking into consideration the provisions of the Administrative Tribunal Act and the rules framed under Section 35(2)(c) thereof and in particular Rules 8 and 16, it was held:

""17. In our considered view, the High Court has gone wrong in considering the service in CAT as re-employment in connection with the affairs of the Union. On the contrary, an independent judicial service, the appointment in the CAT is on tenure basis. The pension relating to such post is clearly governed by Rule 8 of the Rules quoted above and at the risk of repetition, we may state it exhaustive in nature. If that be so, there is no scope for resort to Rule 16 at all. If the first respondent had to resign from Judicial Service because of the statutory requirement under Rule 5 of the Rules (quoted above), we are unable to see as to how both the services namely senior District Judge in the State Judicial Service and a Member in the CAT could be clubbed. Such a clubbing is not contemplated at all. From this point of view, we find it difficult to accept the reasoning of the High Court that the matter of opinion to club the two services for pension is a subject on which the Rules are silent and the residuary provision in Rule 16 of the Rules intends to fill the gap by supplementing the Rules by rules applicable to the Secretary to the Government of India.

18. Merely, because while the first respondent was a Member of the State Judicial Service, he was governed by DCRB Rules of 1958, that cannot be pressed into service in view of the specific Rule 8 of the Rules. Consequently, the provisions relating to pensioners retired on invalid pension is not applicable. The Rules being unambiguous cannot be construed to confer better pensionary benefits. It is no argument to hold that had the first respondent continued in the State Judicial Service, he would have got a higher pension. There is no escape from Rule 8 of the Rules with regard to the grant of pension of Chairman, Vice-Chairman or the Members of the Tribunal. That being so, the question of liberally construing pension rules does not arise. On the same reasoning, the principle laid down in D.S. Nakara case is not applicable.""

21. We may further notice that a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Pasupati Nath Sukur etc. v. Nem Chandra Jain and Ors. etc. MANU/SC/0216/1983MANU/SC/0216/1983 : [1984]1SCR939 while considering the question as to who would constitute Government servant, upon referring to the decision of this court in Pradvat Kumar v. Hon'ble Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court MANU/SC/0023/1955MANU/SC/0023/1955 : [1955]2SCR1331 held that holders of a constitutional post are not eligible to contest election to Parliament and the State Legislative in view of Article 102(1)(a) and Article 191(1)(a) of the Constitution, as the case may be, because they are serving in connection with affairs of the Union and, therefore, are holding the office of profits under the Central Government.

22. The said question came up for consideration again before a three-Judge Bench of this Court in V.S. Mallinath v. Union of India and Anr. MANU/SC/0186/2001MANU/SC/0186/2001 : [2001]2SCR567 . The petitioner therein after his retirement as a Chief Justice of the Kerala High Court was appointed as a Chairman of the Central Administrative Tribunal and upon retirement from the said office he was appointed as a member of the National Human Rights Commission, wherein he continued till he attained the age of 70 years. One of the contentions advanced on behalf of the petitioner was that he was entitled to full salary and the benefit of gratuity for the period he rendered his service in the National Human Rights Commission. Strong reliance in support of the aforementioned contention was placed on Pratibha Bonnerjea (supra). Pattanaik, J. (as the learned Chief Justice then was) speaking for the Bench referred to Pashupati Nath Sukul (supra) and approved the ratio laid down therein and rejected the contention that full salary or gratuity would be payable to the petitioner.

23. In Justice Nand Lal Ganguly (supra) the Allahabad High Court proceeded to determine the matter relying on or on the basis of Pratibha Bonnerjea alone without considering the matter in details. Even the ratio of Pratibha Banerjea was misapplied inasmuch as therein the question of clubbing of two services did not arise for consideration. For the reasons mentioned hereinbefore, Justice Nand Lal Ganguly (supra) cannot be held to have laid down any good law and is overruled accordingly.

24. It may be true that this Court did not grant special leave to appeal from the judgment of Justice Nand Lal Ganguly (supra) but the same by itself would not render the decision as binding precedent in terms of Article 141 of the Constitution of India.

25. In Kunhayammed and Ors. v. State of Kerala and Anr. MANU/SC/0432/2000MANU/SC/0432/2000 : [2000]245ITR360(SC) this Court, inter alia, held:

""(iv) An order refusing special leave to appeal may be a non-speaking order or a speaking one. In either case it does not attract the doctrine of merger. An order refusing special leave to appeal does not stand substituted in place of the order under Challenge. All that it means is that Court was not inclined to exercise its discretion so as to allow the appeal being filed.

(v) If the order refusing leave to appeal is a speaking order, i.e., gives reasons for refusing the grant of leave, then the order has two implications. Firstly, the statement of law contained in the order is a declaration of law by the Supreme court within the meaning of Article 141 of the Constitution. Secondly, other than the declaration of law, whatever is stated in the order are the findings recorded by the Supreme Court which would bind the parties thereto and also the Court, tribunal or authority in any proceedings subsequent thereto by way of judicial discipline, the Supreme Court being the Apex Court of the country. But, this does not amount to saying that the order of the court, tribunal or authority below has stood merged in the order of the Supreme Court rejecting special leave petition or that the order of the Supreme Court is the only order binding as res judicata in subsequent proceedings between the parties.""

26. We, therefore, in agreement with the judgment of the Madras High Court are of the opinion that for the purpose of computation of pension different; services of the petitioner could not have been clubbed in terms of Act 28 of 1954. The pension payable to a High Court Judge would be only for the period rendered in that capacity which would constitute charge to the consolidated fund of India and services rendered subsequent thereto in terms of the order made by a State Government would not be charged to the consolidated fund. The question as to whether such a person would be entitled to pension from the concerned State or not would depend upon the statute or the terms and conditions of appointment.

27. For the reasons aforementioned, we are of the opinion that it is not a fit case wherein special leave to appeal should be granted. The petition is dismissed accordingly.

N. Santosh Hegde, J.

1. In regard to an incident which took place on 5.5.1990 at about 8.30 p.m. in village Jangal, Police Station Pathankot, a complaint was lodged against 6 accused persons which was recorded by ASI Ram Dass and on completion of the said investigation, he filed a chargesheet only against Nachhattar Singh A-1, Prem Singh A-5 and Sukhdev Singh A-6. During the course of the trial, the learned Sessions Judge found sufficient material to proceed under Section 319 of Cr.P.C. against the other 3 accused, namely, Balram Singh A-2. Khushal Singh A-3 and Parhlad Singh A-4, and having included them in the array of accused persons, he tried all the six for the offence punishable under Sections 307, 302, 326, 324, 148 read with Section 149 IPC.

2. In appeal before the High Court of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh, the High Court allowed the appeal of 3 of the accused persons, namely, A-4 to A-6, and confirmed the conviction and sentence imposed on the other 3 appellants i.e. A-1 to A-3.

3. Out of the 3 accused persons convicted by the High Court, A-1 has not preferred any appeal and only A-2 and A-3 are before us in this appeal.

4. The prosecution case, stated briefly, is that in view of some previous enmity arising out of the fact that Prem Singh A-5 had called the sons of deceased Kirpal Singh as 'Bhangi' and drunkards, there was some altercation a few days earlier between the two groups belonging to A-1 and the deceased Kirpal Singh. It is pursuant to the abovesaid incident, on 5.5.1990 at about 8.30 p.m. when deceased Kirpal Singh and his daughter Smt. Raj Karni PW-1 were coming towards their house from their cattle shed in front of the house of Nachhater Singh (A-1), A-1 intercepted the deceased armed with an axe along with Balram Singh A-2 was holding a Takua, Khushal Singh A-3 armed with a Kirpan, Parhlad Singh A-4 armed with a dang, Prem Singh A-5 and Sukhdev Singh A-6 who were unarmed. It is the prosecution case that all these persons attacked the deceased and PW-1 during which attack A-1 gave a Kulhari blow on the head of deceased Kirpal Singh, consequent to which the deceased fell down still A-1 continued to inflict more blows on the fallen body of the deceased. At that time, when PW-1 raised an alarm hearing which Kashmir Singh PW-2 came to the spot and he was also attacked by A-2 with a Taqua and A-3 also gave blows with Kirpan on the back and abdomen of PW-2. The further blows given by A-2 fell on the left arm, right leg and left heel of PW-2. At that time, A-1 gave blows to PW-1 on left arm and left hand. Thereafter PW-2 was dragged into the house of A-1 by accused persons. However, due to the intervention of the people who had by then gathered there, PW-2 was saved and the injured persons including the deceased were removed to the Civil Hospital, Gurdaspur in a car. It is further stated that on the way to the hospital, Kirpal Singh succumbed to his injuries. PWs. 1 and 2 were medically examined in Civil Hospital, Gurdaspur, and the doctor who examined PWs. 1 and 2 sent an intimation to the Police Gurdaspur at about 10.25 p.m. It has come in the prosecution evidence that the distance between the place of the incident and the hospital is about 17 kms. The Police at Gurdaspur Police Station who received the intimation, having come to know that the incident in question had taken place within the territorial jurisdiction of Sadar Police Station Pathankot sent intimation to the said Pathankot Police Station and Ram Dass. ASI of the Pathankot Police Station travelled to the hospital in Gurdaspur which is about 40 kms. away from the Pathankot Police Station and reached the hospital at about 9.15 a.m. on 6.5.1990 and he then recorded the statements of injured witnesses and registered an FIR and after investigation filed the charge sheet as against the named accused and the trial court as stated above in the course of trial included three more persons in the array of accused.

5. The prosecution in support of its case had examined PWs. 1 and 2 as eye-witnesses to the incident in question. It further examined Dr. Sudhir Kumar PW-3 who treated the said injured witnesses, Dr. Jatinder Kumar PW-5 who conducted the post mortem on the dead body of the deceased and Ram Dass. ASI, PW-4 who conducted the investigation as also other formal witnesses, the accused on their part had also examined defence witnesses to prove their case of right of private defence exercised by A-1 during which act of his, he had caused some injuries to the deceased, while other accused took the plea of total denial.

6. Herein, it may be noted that Nachhattar Singh A-1 and Prem Singh A-5 are direct brothers. Balram Singh A-2 and Khushal Singh A-3 are direct brothers. A-4 is the son-in-law of A-3 and A-6 is the brother-in-law of A-1 and A-5. It has also come in evidence that A-2 and A-3 are also inter se related with the other accused.

7. Learned Sessions Judge, as stated above, accepting the prosecution case in toto, convicted all the accused persons before him, of offences as stated above and in appeal, the High Court had accepted the prosecution case only in regard to accused A-1 to A-3 while it gave the benefit of doubt in regard to A-4 to A-6 and acquitted them of all charges. Nachhattar Singh A-1 has not preferred any appeal against his conviction and sentence which has become final. It is only Balram Singh A-2 and Khushal Singh A-3 who have preferred this appeal. State has not preferred any appeal against the acquittal of A-4 to A-6.

8. Mr. Mahabir Singh, learned counsel for the appellants, very seriously contended that there has been considerable delay in filing the FIR. This was because of the fact that the complainant with the help of the police wanted to include all the relatives of A-1, therefore, after considerable deliberations, names of all other accused persons were also included in the complaint therefore even though the Police came to know of the incident in question on the mid-night between 5th and 6th May, 1990, a copy of the FIR with special report as contemplated under Section 157 Cr.P.C. reached the jurisdictional Magistrate only at about 0305 hrs. on 6.5.1990. He also contended that the motive alleged by the prosecution could be hardly any reason to commit the murder. Learned counsel also contended that it is because of this manipulation that the prosecution has not been able to examine any independent witness though admittedly they were present at the time of the incident. He also contended that there is contradiction on material facts in the evidence of PWs. 1 and 2 who are the only eye-witnesses in this case. Learned counsel further contended that the High Court has seriously erred in invoking Section 34 IPC to convict the appellants who according to learned counsel, had absolutely no role to pay in this fight that is even assuming that they were really present at the time of the incident. He supported this argument of his by contending that though originally it was only Section 149 IPC which was invoked against all the accused persons, the High Court having acquitted 3 of the accused erroneously invoked Section 34 to convict these appellants because the prosecution could not prove any overt act against the appellants.

9. On the contrary, Mr. B.R. Jad, learned counsel for the respondent, supported the judgment of the High Court.

10. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the records. It is true that there is some delay in the FIR reaching the jurisdictional Magistrate. In our opinion, the prosecution has given satisfactory explanation for this delay. The incident in question took place at about 8.30 p.m. on 5.5.1990 which must have gone on for some time before the injured could be transported to the hospital at Gurdaspur which is about 17 kms. away from the place of the incident. From the evidence of Dr. Sudhir Kumar, PW-3, it is clear that these injured persons and the deceased were brought to the hospital at about 10.25 p.m. and on coming to know of the medico-legal aspect of the case, he had intimated the Police Station at Gurdaspur of the incident but the said Police having come to know that the incident had occurred within the jurisdiction of Police Station Sadar Pathankot, informed the said Police of this medico-legal case which Police Station is situated at about 40 kms. from the place of the incident and taking into consideration said distance and the law and order situation then obtaining in Punjab, during the relevant period, we do not find anything unusual in the SHO of P.S. Sadar Pathankot, namely, Ram Dass, ASI, PW-4, reaching the hospital around 9 a.m. on 6.5.1990. It has come in evidence that after recording the statement and making arrangements for the post mortem of the dead body of the deceased, the FIR recorded was sent to the jurisdictional Magistrate which reached him around 0305 hrs. on 6.5.1990. After considering the argument of learned counsel in regard to this delay in sending the FIR to the jurisdictional Magistrate, we notice that in reality there is no delay in preparing the FIR but there was some delay in transmitting the said information to the jurisdictional Magistrate. Having been satisfied with the fact that the FIR in question was registered in the morning of 6.5.1990, we do not think that the delay thereafter in communicating it to the jurisdictional Magistrate on the facts of this case, has really given any room to doubt that the said document (FIR) was created after much deliberations. At any rate, while considering the complaint of the appellants in regard to the delay in the FIR reaching the jurisdictional Magistrate, we will have to also bear in mind the creditworthiness of the ocular evidence adduced by the prosecution and if we find that such ocular evidence is worthy of acceptance, the element of delay in registering a complaint or sending the same to the jurisdictional Magistrate by itself would not in any manner weaken the prosecution case.

11. As noted above, learned counsel then contended that the motive alleged by the prosecution is very weak. This again would depend upon the evidence produced by the prosecution in regard to the actual incident. If the incident in question as projected by the prosecution is to be accepted then the presence or absence of a motive or strength of the said motive by itself also will not make the prosecution case weak. In this case the prosecution has pleaded that there was an altercation between the 2 families a few days before the incident, and it is because of the said altercation the incident of 5.5.1990 had occurred in which one person lost his life and 2 persons were seriously injured and if the evidence of said injured witnesses is to be accepted then the existence of nature of motive would hardly matter.

12. The appellants' contention that the prosecution has relied only on interested evidence of PWs. 1 and 2 and has not examined other independent witnesses who were present or for that matter the non examination of another son of the deceased by name Jasbir Singh should give raise to an adverse inference. cannot also be accepted because so far as Jasbir Singh is concerned though there is some material on record to show that he was examined by a doctor on the night of the incident, there is no material to show that he was actually involved in this fight. His name is not mentioned in the FIR also, therefore if the prosecution has thought it not necessary to examine this witness, we do not think an adverse inference could be drawn on the basis of this non-examination of said Jasbir Singh. This view of ours also holds good in regard to the so-called other independent witnesses who were present at the time of the incident since in a family feud like this, it is rarely an independent witness, would come forward to give evidence.

13. Be that as it may, we will have to bear in mind these deficiencies pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellants, while considering the creditworthiness of PWs. 1 and 2, and in this background we consider the evidence of PWs. 1 and 2, we notice that the defence has not been able to create any doubt in their evidence at least so far as the involvement of A-1 and these appellants are concerned. Their evidence in this regard has been consistent and natural. They were injured witnesses and were victims of the assault. The defence has not been able to bring out any material contradiction in the evidence of PWs. 1 and 2. Though the learned counsel for the appellants contended that there is some contradiction in the evidence of PWs. 1 and 2 inter se, in fact he has not been able to point out any such material contradiction. The High Court acquitted the 3 accused persons not on the ground that evidence of PWs. 1 and 2 is false but on the ground that those accused persons who were unarmed, hence, were entitled to the benefit of doubt; whereas in the case of the appellants and A-1, it accepted the evidence of PWs. 1 and 2 in regard to their overt acts in causing injuries to the deceased and these witnesses. Having independently considered the evidence of PWs. 1 and 2, we are of the opinion that the evidence of PWs. 1 and 2 does not suffer from any such contradiction or omission which makes the said evidence unbelievable.

14. The argument of learned counsel that on facts of this case the High Court could not have invoked Section 34 to convict these appellants, seems to be based on the decisions of this Court in Badruddin v. State of U.P. MANU/SC/0806/1998MANU/SC/0806/1998 : 1998CriLJ4591 and Ramashish Yadav and Ors. v. State of Bihar MANU/SC/0559/1999MANU/SC/0559/1999 : 2000CriLJ12 . In those cases, on facts and noticing the nature of involvement of the accused conviction under Section 34 IPC was found to be improper, hence, set aside the said conviction, but in regard to the applicability of Section 34, it was held that all that the prosecution has to establish is that there was a prior concert or meeting of minds between the accused persons and such prior concert or meeting of minds may be determined from the conduct of the offenders unfolding itself during the course of action and the declaration made by them just before mounting the attack. This Court in those cases also held that the common intention can also be developed at the spur of the moment but there must be pre-arrangement or pre-meditated concert. In the instant case it is the prosecution case that at the time of the incident when deceased and PW-1 were walking towards their house the accused persons out of which A-1 and the appellants herein were armed with deadly weapons. With the help of acquitted accused persons, waylaid the deceased. The prosecution says that while A-1 attacked the deceased, PW-1 was prevented by the appellants herein from preventing the said attack on her father and when PW-2 came to the spot and tried to help his father, he was also assaulted with a view to thwart his effort to protect his father. This itself goes to show that when these accused persons gathered in front of the house of A-1 and proceeded to assault the deceased, all of them had shared the common intention of causing death of the deceased. Though these appellants did not assault the accused, it is clear that the manner in which they were armed and the manner in which they prevented PWs. 2 and 3 from protecting their father by causing them grievous injuries also shows that this attack on PWs. 2 and 3 was aimed at ensuring that A-1 was done away wit, and the deceased did not get sufficient protection, therefore, we are of the considered view that the High Court having acquitted the 3 of accused persons was justified in invoking Section 34 to uphold the conviction of the appellants herein.

15. For the reasons stated above, this appeal fails and the same is dismissed.

S.B. Sinha, J.

1. Leave granted.

2. Applicability of Section 28A of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 in a proceeding under the Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act, 1952 (hereinafter referred to as 'the 1952 Act') is in question in these appeals which arise out of judgments and orders passed by Punjab & Haryana High Court in L.P.A. No. 971 of 1999, C.W.P. No. 183 of 1994, L.P.A. No. 914 of 1999 and L.P.A. No. 41 of 2000.

3. The factual matrix of the matter may be adverted to from the civil Appeal arising out of Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 533 of 2001. The lands of the appellants were requisitioned under the Defence of India Act, 1971 for establishment of Military cantonment in the year 1972. They were later on acquired in terms of Section 23(1) of the Defence of India Act. An award of compensation was pronounced on 6th March, 1975 in the following terms:-

4. It is not in dispute that the appellants in relation to the amount of compensation awarded by the respondents herein for acquiring their properties entered into agreements in the prescribed form under the provisions of the 1952 Act, which was made operative for the residual matters flowing from the proceedings of acquisition of lands upon repeal of the Defence of India Act, 1971.

5. Questioning the non-inclusion of interest in the said award they filed a writ petition before the High Court which was marked as C.W.P. No. 4983 of 1976 which were allowed. A special leave petition filed by the respondents herein before this Court marked as Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 74 of 1998 questioning the said order of the High Court was dismissed on 4th September, 1984. Another writ petition was filed by the Appellant claiming solatium before the High Court which was marked as C.W.P. No. 1813 of 1978 and the same was also allowed. It is, however, not in dispute that several other land owners did not accept the said award and made a reference which was referred to an arbitration of the Additional District Judge. By an award dated 20.11.1987 in the case of one Nihal Singh, the said Arbitrator awarded higher compensation together with solatium and interest. Compensation awarded to said Nihal Singh by the Arbitrator was at the following rates:-

6. The said Nihal Singh had also been paid solatium @ 30% and interest @ 9% per annum for one year after acquisition and thereafter @ 15% per annum till realisation.

7. The appellants herein having regard to the said award filed application under Section 28A of the Land Acquisition Act for redetermination of compensation. It is not in dispute that a Full Bench of the Punjab & Haryana High Court in Hari Krishan (decd.) and Ors. v. Union of India and Anr. MANU/PH/0019/1975MANU/PH/0019/1975 had held that even where an acquisition is made under the Defence of India Act, provisions of Section 28A of Land Acquisition Act would be applicable. Presumably, relying on or on the basis of the said decision, the Special Land Acquisition Collector before whom the said purported application under Section 28A was filed, enhanced the compensation by an order dated 30th May, 1988. The said award indisputably was not implemented.

8. This Court in Union of India v. Hari Krishan Khosla (Dead) by L.Rs. [(1993) Supp 2 SCC 149], however held that the provisions of Land Acquisition Act are not applicable in respect of an acquisition made under the 1952 Act.

9. Thereafter, the respondent herein filed a writ petition questioning the said award on the ground that as the provisions of Section 28A of the Land Acquisition Act were not applicable in relation to acquisition under the Defence of India Act or the 1952 Act, the said award dated 30th May, 1988 was illegal and without jurisdiction. Before the High Court, the appellants herein, inter alia, raised a question of maintainability of the writ petition on the ground delay and latches on the part of the respondents, as allegedly the writ petition had been filed after a period of five years. By reason of a judgment and order dated 1.4.1999 a learned Single Judge of the High Court upon setting aside the order of the Special Land Acquisition Collector dated 30.5.1988 allowed the writ petition where-against the appellants preferred an intra-court appeal which also came to be dismissed by reason of the impugned judgment dated 27th January, 2000.

10. Mr. O.P. Sharma, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants in the civil Appeals arising out of Special Leave Petition (Civil) Nos. 11687 and 17079 of 2000 and SLP (Civil).....(C 4700 of 2001) would contend that no doubt this Court in Union of India v. Gurbachan Singh and Ors. MANU/SC/0538/1995MANU/SC/0538/1995 : (1995)1SCC292 and Union of India and Anr. v. Babu Singh and Ors. MANU/SC/1016/1996MANU/SC/1016/1996 : (1996)1SCC477 following its decision in Hari Krishan Khosla's case (supra) has held that in relation to an acquisition under the provisions of the 1952 Act, Section 28A of the Land Acquisition Act would not be maintainable but therein this Court did not take into consideration the question that if the provisions for grant of solatium and interest in terms of Sections 23(1) and 23(2) of Land Acquisition Act would apply in relation to acquisition under the 1952 Act, there is absolutely no reason as to why a proceeding under Section 28A would not be maintainable. Learned counsel in support of his argument placed strong reliance on a Seven-Judge Bench of this Court in Nagpur Improvement Trust and Anr. v. Vithal Rao and Ors. MANU/SC/0518/1972MANU/SC/0518/1972 : [1973]3SCR39 . U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad v. Jainul Islam and Anr. MANU/SC/0055/1998MANU/SC/0055/1998 : [1998]1SCR254 and a recent judgment of this Court in Nagpur Improvement Trust etc. v. Vasantrao and Ors. etc. MANU/SC/0839/2002MANU/SC/0839/2002 : [2002]SUPP2SCR636 .

11. Mr. P.S. Narasimhma, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants in civil Appeal arising out of Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 533 of 2001 would submit that although Section 28A of the Land Acquisition Act per se is not applicable to a proceeding under the 1952 Act, the said provisions should be read into therein. The learned counsel drew our attention to the said provisions of Section 28A of the Act and submitted that in a case where the parties entered into an agreement in terms of Clause (a) of Sub-section (1) of Section 8 of the 1952 Act, there is no reason as to why the parties cannot enter into another agreement having regard to the fact that the Arbitrator has awarded enhanced compensation for acquisition of similarly situated lands. The learned counsel drawing our attention to the provisions of Sub-section (3) of Section 8 of the 1952 Act would submit that compensation required to be paid even under the 1952 Act being on the market value of the land, and, thus, the criteria for determination of compensation being the same, the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act should be held to be applicable being implicitly embodied therein. In support of the said contention, strong reliance was placed on Haji Mahammad Ekramul Haq v. The State of West Bengal MANU/SC/0055/1998MANU/SC/0055/1998 : [1998]1SCR254 .

12. The 1952 Act was enacted to provide for the requisitioning and acquisition of immovable property for the purpose of the Union. The history of the said legislation and the purport and object thereof need not be noticed by us in view of the question involved herein. Section 3 of the said Act provides for power of the Central Government to requisition immovable property. Section 4 empowers the competent authority to take possession of the requisitioned property. Section 5 which provides for rights over requisitioned property reads thus:-

""Rights over requisition property.--(1) All Property requisitioned under Section 3 shall be used for such purchases as may be mentioned in the notice of requisition.

(2) Where any premises are requisitioned under Section 3, the competent authority may order the landlord to execute such repairs as may be necessary and are usually made by landlords in that locality and as may be specified in the notice, within such reasonable time as may be mentioned therein and if the landlord fails to execute any repairs in pursuance of such order, the competent authority may cause the repairs specified in the order to be executed at the expense of the landlord and the cost thereof may, without prejudice to any other mode of recovery, be deducted from the compensation payable to the landlord.""

13. A requisitioned property can be released from requisition in terms of Section 6, Section 7 confers power upon the Central Government to acquire the requisitioned property. The principles and method of determining compensation are laid down in Section 8 of the said At which reads as under:-

8. Principles and method of determining compensation.--(1) Where any property is requisitioned or acquired under this Act, there shall be paid compensation the amount of which shall be determined in the manner and in accordance with the principles hereinafter set out, that is to say:-

(a) where the amount of compensation can be fixed by agreement, it shall be paid in accordance with such agreement.

(b) where no such agreement can be reached, the Central Government shall appoint as arbitrator a person who is or has been, or is qualified for appointment as a Judge of a High Court;

(c) the Central Government may, in any particular case, nominate a person having expert knowledge as to the nature of the property requisitioned or acquired to assist the arbitrator and where such nomination is made, the person to be compensated may also nominate an assessor for the same purpose;

(d) at the commencement of the proceedings before the arbitrator, the Central Government and the person to be compensated shall state what in their respective opinion is a fair amount of compensation;

(e) the arbitrator shall, after hearing the dispute, make an award determining the award of compensation which appears to him to be just and specifying the person or persons to whom such compensation shall be paid; and in making the award, he shall have regard to the circumstances of each case and the provisions of Sub-section (2) and (3), so far as they are applicable;

(f) where there is any dispute as to the person or persons who are entitled to the compensation, the arbitrator shall decide such dispute and if the arbitrator finds that more persons than one are entitled to compensation, he shall apportion the amount thereof amongst such persons;

(g) nothing in the Arbitration Act, 1940 shall apply to arbitrations under this section.

14. Sub-sections (2A) and (2B) of Section 8 of the 1952 Act lay down the mode and manner for determination of compensation on requisitioning of the property.

15. Sub-section (3) of Section 8 thereof reads as under:

(3) The compensation payable for the acquisition of any property under Section 7 shall be the price which the requisitioned property would have fetched in the open market. If it had remained in the same condition as it was at the time of requisitioning and been sold on the date of acquisition.""

16. The acquisition of the lands of the appellants as also the award and the writ petitions as noticed hereinbefore, have been made and disposed of prior to coming into force of Section 28A of the Land Acquisition Act.

17. The 1952 Act is a self-contained Code. The 1952 Act not only lays down a criteria for determination of compensation but also provides for the mode and manner thereof. The procedures for determining the award of compensation are not the same.

18. The provisions of the Land Acquisition Act are ex-facie not applicable for determination of compensation under the 1952 Act. The provisions of the Land Acquisition Act and the 1952 Act are, thus, not in pari-materia. Section 23 of the Land Acquisition Act 1894, on the other hand lays down the factors which are required to be taken into consideration in determining the amount of compensation. The mode and manner in which the compensation payable for acquisition of land under the 1952 Act and Land Acquisition Act, 1894 are, thus, distinct and different. We fail to see as to how the provisions of Section 28A of the Land Acquisition Act can be made applicable in relation to a proceeding under the 1952 Act.

19. Furthermore, the criteria for determination of compensation in terms of Sub-section (3) of Section 8 must be viewed with the limitations contained therein. In any event the market value of a property may also be determined from the stand-point of a willing purchaser of the land ready and willing to offer the consideration therefore to a buyer. The owner of a land normally would opt for the best offer. Once he has agreed to a price; so far as he is concerned the same ordinarily should be presumed to be the best offer which he could get.

20. It may be true that in Haji Mohammad Ekrmul Haq's case (supra) this Court observed that even in the matter of payment of compensation under the 1952 Act, the criteria laid down under the Land Acquisition Act would be applicable. However, Section 8 of the 1952 Act underwent amendments and the provisions of the 1952 Act having not only laid down a complete machinery but also the mode and manner of determining compensation the said decision of this Court cannot be said to have any application in the instant case.

21. This Court in Gurbachan Singh's case (supra) and Babu Singh's case (supra), in view of the aforementioned distinction following the judgment of this Court in Hari Krishan Khosla's case (supra) clearly laid down the law that Section 28A of the Land Acquisition Act cannot be applied in relation to an acquisition proceeding under the 1952 Act.

22. Reliance placed by the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Petitioner in Hukam Chand and Ors. v. State of Haryana and Ors. MANU/SC/1186/1996MANU/SC/1186/1996 : [1996]3SCR1087 is mis-placed. Therein the questions raised herein did not fall for consideration. In the Land Acquisition Act, 1891, a provision exists for reference whereas in terms of the provisions of 1952 Act, only in the event the owner of the land does not accept the amount of compensation offered to him, the dispute in relation thereto may be referred to an arbitrator. We may note that although in these cases the dispute as regards amount of compensation was not referred to arbitrator but the appellants herein filed writ petitions claiming solatium and interest. They, thus, did take the matter to a Competent Court of Law and the said proceeding had a direct bearing on the amount of compensation received by them. In he event it be held that the provisions of Section 28A of the Land Acquisition Act is maintainable in a proceeding under the 1952 Act, not only there would be an enhancement in the quantum of compensation but also corresponding enhancement in solatium and interest, which, in view of the orders passed in the writ petitions, would be impermissible.

23. In Union of India and Ors. v. Dhanwati Devi and Ors. MANU/SC/1272/1996MANU/SC/1272/1996 : (1996)6SCC44 a three judge bench of this Court:

""14. The question, therefore, emerges whether it is necessary for the State Legislature to expressly specify that interest or solatium shall not be payable for the lands of property acquired under Section 7(1) of the Act. Sub silentio is eloquent. It would further be seen that Section 8 of the Central Act equally does not provide for payment of solatium and interest. The Act was passed in the year 1968 while the Central Act was passed in 1952. It would, therefore, be reasonable to conclude that the State Legislature was cognizant of the express provisions for payment of interest and solatium available in the Acquisition Act. The Act omitted similar provisions for payment of interest and solatium as part or component of compensation, obviously to fall in line with the Central Act.""

24. The Bench agreed with the reasoning in Hari Krishan Khosla case (supra).

25. The ratio of Dhanwanti Devi case applies in the instant case.

26. The decision of this Court in Nagpur Improvement Trust (supra) may not be of much assistance in the instant case inasmuch as therein it was noticed that the U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad Adhiniyam, 1965, Nagpur Improvement Trust Act, 1936 as also the Punjab Town Improvement Act, 1922 which tell for consideration therein had a common scheme and pattern as the State legislations relate to Town Planning and Development and in terms of which, each one of them as regards acquisition of land, the Land Acquisition Act, 1984 was made applicable with certain modifications as contained in the Schedules appended thereto. In that view of the matter, the Bench followed the earlier decision of this Court in U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad (supra) [wherein one of us (Hon'ble the Chief Justice) was a member]. Therein Hari Krishan Khosla (supra) was held to be not applicable as provisions of the Land Acquisition Act as amended by the 1984 Act relating to determination and payment of compensation were held to be applicable to acquisition of land for the purposes of the Adhiniyam.

27. As at present advised and furthermore in view in the factual matrix involved in the present appeals, we do not intend to enter into the question as to whether the said decisions have correctly been rendered or not.

28. It is he admitted case of the appellants that they entered into with the respondents agreements as regards the amount of compensation payable for acquisition of their lands in the prescribed form in terms of Clause (a) of Sub-section (1) of Section 8. What was only questioned by them in the writ proceedings was non-payment of solatium and interest. The High Court in the said writ proceedings indisputably came to the conclusion that even solatium and interest was payable. The correctness or otherwise of the said decisions is not in question.

29. However, once it is held that Section 28A of the Land Acquisition Act is not applicable in relation to lands of the appellants the only question which survives for consideration is as to whether the appellants have any legal right to force the respondents herein to enter into a fresh agreement relying on or on the awards passed by the arbitrator in 1987.

30. The answer to the said question, in our considered opinion, must be rendered in the negative. It has rightly been accepted at the bar that in the event a reference is made to an Arbitrator by the owner of the lands, Section 28A of the Land Acquisition Act would not be applicable.

31. The parties herein entered into agreements in terms of Clause (a) of Sub-section (1) of Section 8 and, thus, the same falls within the realm of a contract, and parties thereto would ordinarily be bound thereby unless the same is vitiated by fraud, misrepresentation etc.

32. Once the matter is concluded by a contract, novation of contract would also fall within the realm of contract only. If the contention of Mr. Narasimha is accepted, a contract can be reopened only with the agreement of both the parties. The parties must be ad-idem therefore.

33. The person whose lands were acquired, thus, having entered into an agreement cannot be said to have any legal right which can be enforced in a court of law so as to enable him to obtain an order from the Court directing the Union of India to reopen the agreement, only because by reason of a subsequent award an enhanced amount of compensation has been paid for similar class of lands. If a right to get the amount of compensation re-determined is held to be implicit in the Act, the same for all intent and purport would amount to invoking the provisions of Section 28A of the Land Acquisition Act indirectly which cannot be done directly. It is a well-settled principle of law that what cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly.

34. The enforceable right to re-open a proceeding, which has attained finality, must exist in the Statute itself.

35. The right to get the amount of compensation re-determined must expressly be provided by the statute. Such a right being a substantive one cannot be sought to be found out by implication nor can the same be read therewith.

36. The appellants, thus, cannot invoke a right by reading the same into a statute although admittedly there exists none.

37. It is well-settled principle of law that the court cannot read anything into the statutory provision which is plain and unambiguous. The court has to find out legislative intent only from the language employed in the statutes. Surmises and conjectures cannot be restricted to for interpretation of statutes. [See Union of India and Ors. v. Filip Tiago De Gama of Vedem Vasco De Gama MANU/SC/0622/1989MANU/SC/0622/1989 : (1990)1SCC277 ].

38. This Court in Bhavnagar University v. Palitana Sugar Mill Pvt. Ltd. and Ors. MANU/SC/1092/2002MANU/SC/1092/2002 : AIR2003SC511 , has observed:-

""Scope of the legislation on the intention of the legislature cannot be enlarged when the language of the provision is plain and unambiguous. In other words statutory enactments must ordinarily be construed according to its plain meaning and no words shall be added altered or modified unless it is plainly necessary to do so to prevent a provision from being unintelligible, absurd, unreasonable, unworkable or totally irreconcilable with the rest of the statute.""

39. [See also Unique Butyle Tube Industries Pvt. Ltd. v. U.P. Financial Corporation and Ors. MANU/SC/1218/2002MANU/SC/1218/2002 : [2002]SUPP5SCR666 ].

40. For the views we have taken, we are of the opinion that it is not necessary to go into the larger question raised by the learned counsel for the parties in these matters.

41. Submission of Mr. Narasimha to the effect that the Collector himself having made an award by order dated 30th May, 1988 the Central Government could not have filed a writ petition, is stated to be rejected. The contention of the Central Government, respondent herein, in the writ petition was that as the provision of Section 28A of the Land Acquisition Act being not applicable the Special Land Acquisition Collector acted illegally and without jurisdiction in reopening the matter and passing a supplementary award. Such a contention was raised on the basis of a decision of this Court. Furthermore, the Special Land Acquisition Collector is a creature of the statute. He, therefore, was bound to act within the four-corners thereof. If he has passed an order invoking a provision of law which was not applicable, he committed jurisdictional error and the order impugned before the High Court by the respondents was a nullity. We, therefore, cannot accept the contention of the appellants that the respondents was not a person aggrieved and thus could not have maintained the writ petition.

42. It was submitted that the respondents having filed a writ petition after a period of eight years, the same ought not to have entertained. Primarily a question of delay and latches is a matter which is required to be considered by the writ court. Once the writ has exercised its jurisdiction despite delay and latches on the part of the respondents, it is not for us at this stage to set aside the order of the High Court that ground alone particularly when we find that the impugned judgment is legally sustainable.

43. For the foregoing reasons, we do not find any merit in these appeals which are accordingly dismissed but in the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs.

2. These appeals by special leave call in question a judgment and order dated 19th November, 2012 passed by the High Court of Karnataka at Gulbarga whereby Criminal Appeal No. 1926 of 2007 has been allowed, judgment and order of the Trial Court acquitting the Appellants set aside, and the Appellants convicted and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of seven years Under Section 304 Part II read with Section 34 Indian Penal Code. A fine of Rs. 5,000/- each and a default sentence of imprisonment for a period one year has also been awarded to the Appellant.

3. The prosecution case in brief is that three years before the date of incident CW-11 Md. Shafi sold two acres of land to CW-2 Lingappa. The accused-Appellants herein were upset by the said sale transaction and are alleged to be picking up quarrels with CW-2 besides causing obstruction in the free flow of water to the fields owned by the complainant from a distributory at Narayanapur. The Appellants are alleged to be insisting that they will let water for irrigation flow only if the land purchased by the complainant was transferred in their favour. Lingappa was on that count coerced to sell the said two acres of land purchased from Mohd. Sahfi to accused-Abdul Razak. Despite this, however, the obstruction in the flow of water continued as the Appellants started demanding money for letting the water flow. It was in the above background that on 19th September, 2006 at about 7.30 p.m. the Appellants are alleged to have caught hold of Lingappa's son Basavaraj-deceased while he was returning home, tied his hands behind his back splashed chilly powder on his face and assaulted him with a club of stones causing injuries on his head and other parts of body leading to his death. The incident is alleged to have been witnessed by Hanumantha (PW-1), brother of the deceased, and Mannamma (PW-4), mother of the deceased. In connection with the incident Crime No. 168 of 2006 was registered at Hutti Police Station for an offence punishable Under Section 302 read with Section 34 Indian Penal Code against the Appellants herein.

4. A charge-sheet, after completion of investigation, was filed against the Appellants before the jurisdictional Court for their committal. The Appellants pleaded not guilty before the Additional Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court-II, Raichur, to whom the case was made over for trial. At the trial the prosecution examined as many as 22 witnesses besides placing reliance upon several documents produced on its behalf.

5. In their statements Under Section 313 Code of Criminal Procedure, the Appellants denied the incriminating circumstances appearing against them, but led no evidence in their defence. The Trial Court on an appraisal of the prosecution evidence came to the conclusion that the prosecution had failed to bring home the guilt of the accused for the offences allegedly committed by them. Aggrieved by the order of acquittal the State preferred an appeal before the High Court of Karnataka which was heard and allowed by a Division Bench of that Court holding the Appellants guilty of the offence punishable Under Section 304 Part II read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentencing them to undergo imprisonment for a period of seven years with fine and default sentence mentioned above. The present appeal assails the correctness of the said order.

6. We have heard Learned Counsel for the parties who have taken us through the orders passed by the courts below.

7. The prosecution case primarily rests on the depositions of Haumantha (PW-1), brother of the deceased, who was also the first informant and Mannamma (PW-4), mother of the deceased both of whom claimed to be eye witnesses to the occurrence.

8. In his deposition before the Trial Court PW-1 refers to the purchase of land and resultant enmity between the Appellants and the complainant party. He also refers to the dispute regarding the irrigation channel and the civil litigation between the two sides before the Sindhanaur Court. According to the witness, on the fateful day the deceased-Basavaraj had gone to a restaurant (dhaba) owned by PW-6 Basappa. At about 6.00 p.m. he heard Basavaraj shouting for help whereupon he and his mother PW-4 rushed towards the land of one Swami from where they saw Pathe Sab (A-3) throwing chilly powder towards Basavaraj whose hands had been tied behind his back. He also saw A-3 assaulting deceased-Basavaraj on the head and A-2 and A-4 also doing so with a stick and stone. When he stepped forward to rescue Basavaraj, his mother-PW4 dissuaded him from doing so. The accused persons then left the spot whereafter the witness and his mother went near the injured but returned home. Sometime later they again went to the field with PW3-Lingappa who too saw his son Basvaraj in an injured condition. PW-3 is then said to have gone to Gurgunta police post to inform the police about the incident and returned at about 6.00 p.m. It was only at about 10.00 p.m. that a Sub Inspector from Hutti police station came to the spot in a Jeep. PW-1 Hanumantha presented to him a written complaint about the incident. He also narrated the incident to the police Sub Inspector which was reduced to writing by him and treated as the first information report marked as Ex. P-1 at the trial. The witness further states that it was the ASI of police who directed him to untie the ropes from the hands of deceased-Basavaraj which he accordingly did. Deceased-Basavaraj was then shifted in an injured condition to Government Hospital at Lingasugur. PWs. 1 and 3 also accompanied the injured, but the injured Basavaraj breathed his last on the way. The deposition of PW-4 mother of the deceased-Basavaraj is also on the same lines.

9. The Trial Court appraised the version given by the two witnesses but came to the conclusion that the same was unreliable. The Trial Court gave more than one reason for its view. In the first place, the Trial Court found the conduct of PWs 1 and 4 who are closely related to the deceased unnatural. The Trial Court held that if their version that they were witnesses to the occurrence was correct, there was no reason why they would not intervene to rescue the deceased from the clutches of the assailants. More importantly, the Trial Court held that PW1, brother and PW4, mother of the deceased, instead of untying the deceased who was in a seriously injured condition, returned home even after the assailants had fled away from the spot. What is worse is that even after returning home PWs. 1 and 4 accompanied by PW-3 who is none other than the father of the deceased had gone back to the place of occurrence where they found the deceased in an injured condition with his hands tied behind his back, his leg broken/fractured and eyes burning with chilly powder, but made no effort to untie his hands or rush him to the hospital for treatment. Instead PW-3 father of the deceased went to lodge a report with the police leaving the injured in a hapless condition on the spot where he was lying only to wait till 10.00 p.m. at night for the police to arrive. If the prosecution version is correct, it is only after instructions were given by the Sub-Inspector to PW-1 to untie the hands of Basavaraj that he does so. The injured Basavaraj was then put in the police Jeep for being taken to the hospital where he reached only after he had died. The Trial Court found the story, the sequence of events and the conduct of the prosecution witnesses who claim to be eye witnesses to the incident to be wholly unnatural and unreliable. The Trial Court was, in our opinion perfectly justified in taking that view. The conduct of the prosecution witnesses does not inspire confidence not only because they did not intervene when Basavaraj was being assaulted but also because post the event, the witnesses did practically nothing to help the unfortunate soul, who was left to die with his hands tied for over 4 hours without any succor coming from any quarter. The High Court has made light of these aspects and thereby fallen in an error.

10. Although the accused have alleged that Hanumantha PW-1 who had a dispute over money and land with the deceased was actually responsible for causing the injuries sustained by him, yet even assuming that there was no such bad blood between the two brothers, both PW-1 and his mother PW-4 would have in the ordinary course rushed to intervene to save the deceased from being belaboured. No such attempt was made by any one of them nor even by PW-5 who happens to be chance witness. So much so, they do not make any attempt to help the injured after the alleged assailants had fled from the spot. It is most unnatural for PW-4 mother and PW-1 brother of the deceased to return home leaving the injured in a hapless condition with his hands tied behind his back. Equally unnatural is the conduct of the father of the deceased who along with PW-1 and PW-4 came to the spot where the deceased was lying injured but did nothing to help him. Instead, PW-4 the father of the deceased leaves the deceased in a critical condition to report the matter to the police. What makes the entire story unacceptable is that the mother PW-4 and the son PW-1 wait till 10.00 p.m. when the police arrive to untie the hands of the deceased. That is not all. After the police arrived, PW-1 presents a written complaint about the incident. His statement (fardbeyan) is recorded by the Sub-Inspector in which Basavaraj is said to have died, meaning thereby that Basavaraj was not alive when the police reached the spot. What is amazing is the admission made by PW-19 that the report received by him about the incident was destroyed by him after the fardbeyan of PW-1 was recorded on the spot. This implies that the first version regarding the incident was totally obliterated by the Investigating Officer and Exb. P-1 recorded in its place. It is difficult to appreciate how PW-19 could have destroyed the original complaint given to him by Hanumantha PW-1. This implies that the earliest version about the incident was destroyed by PW-19 and a new story stated in the fardbeyan was tailored to suit the prosecution version. This has the effect of completely demolishing the prosecution case and rendering its version wholly unacceptable. The only inference which can, in the circumstances, be drawn is that Basavaraj was done to death and his dead body left at the spot from where it was picked-up by the police after they arrived around 10.00 p.m. The complaint presented to Sub-Inspector perhaps did not say what the police intended to present as its case. The same was, therefore, destroyed and a new version brought in, according to which Basavaraj was shown to be alive when the police reached the spot. The fact of the matter, however, appears to be that Basavaraj was dead when his brother, mother and father discovered the body, for otherwise there was no question of the parents of the deceased and his brother leaving him alone in the condition, which they are alleged to have done. The conclusion drawn by the Trial Court that the prosecution had not proved the charges against the Appellants beyond reasonable doubt, was, in our opinion, correct, no matter the judgment and order is not as happily worded as it ought to be, especially coming from a senior judicial officer of the level of Additional Sessions Judge. Inasmuch as the High Court has overlooked all these aspects, we are constrained to set aside the order passed by it and acquit the Appellants of the charges framed against them. We, accordingly, allow this appeal, set aside the judgment and order passed by the High Court and acquit the Appellants of the charges framed against them. The Appellants shall be released from custody forthwith if not required in connection with any other case.

2. We have heard learned Counsel for the parties and perused the impugned judgment.

3. In our opinion, at the time of disposal of the First Appeal, the High Court should have called for the record and proceedings and should have given reasons for coming to a particular conclusion but that has not been done.

4. In such circumstances, the impugned judgment is set aside and the matter is remanded to the High Court so that it can be heard afresh.

5. The parties shall appear before the High Court on 5.9.2016 so that the date of further hearing can be decided.

6. We are sure that the High Court will decide the appeal expeditiously, preferably within six months from the date of the first hearing.

7. With the above observations and directions, the appeal is disposed of as allowed with no orders as to costs.

1. Appellant is a company against whom a winding up petition filed by the Respondent Under Sections 433, 434 and 439 of the Companies Act bearing Company Petition No. 112 of 2002 is pending in the High Court at Calcutta. The plea for winding up is based upon just and equitable grounds. In the facts of the case, after hearing the parties the Court ordered that the shares of the company be valued by an approved auditor so that company would settle the dispute by purchasing the three hundred shares held by the Respondent in the company and bring the dispute to a quietus. The Valuation Report was submitted in January 2004. The Appellant raised objections to the report to which reply was filed by the Respondent. The learned Single Judge on 17.3.2004 directed the Appellant company to purchase the shares of the Respondent as per Valuation Report in respect of the rate of the shares. That order was partly modified on 29.3.2004 to provide that in case of default by the company, the Respondents shall be at liberty to make publication in ""The Statesman"" and ""Anand Bazar Patrika"". By yet another order dated 20.4.2004 learned Single Judge fixed 1.6.2004 as the time schedule by which the Appellant company was required to pay the due amount. All the aforesaid three orders were challenged by the Appellant through an intra-court appeal before the Division Bench bearing Civil Appeal No. 266 of 2004. Ultimately that appeal was dismissed by an order dated 12.7.2004 and that order of the Division Bench is the subject matter of the present appeal.

2. The order of the learned Single Judge dated 17.3.2004 refers to an earlier order dated 7.5.2003 which records that in course of hearing of application for winding up, the parties agreed that the shares of the company be valued so that the management could offer purchase of the shares of the Petitioner (Respondent herein). At the first instance the cost of valuation of shares was ordered to be borne by the Respondent herein. On 17.3.2004 the Court noted that the Valuation Report declared the value of the shares as Rs. 2,530/- per share and at that rate the Respondent herein was agreeable to sell his three hundred shares. The company however offered to buy the shares at Rs. 500/- per share. The Court found such variation in the stand of the company without any reason and hence it directed the company to purchase the shares as per Valuation Report. The Court also directed the Appellant to bear 50% of the cost paid to the valuer by reimbursing the Respondent herein for a sum of Rs. 12,900/-. As noted earlier the above order was modified partly on 29.3.2004 by adding a default clause in case the company failed to make the required payment and further by order dated 20.4.2004 the time for payment was fixed as-on or before 1.6.2004. The Division Bench noted the aforesaid relevant facts and came to the view, and in our opinion rightly, that the case of the parties rested on the issue whether the parties had agreed on 7.5.2003 that the purchase of the shares by the present management will be made as per the valuation to be determined. The only submission advanced before the Division Bench was that the company or its management was not bound to offer for purchase of the shares at the rate determined by the Valuation Report. The Division Bench found such submission to be unacceptable in the light of the gist/substance of the order dated 7.5.2003. The Division Bench inferred that the learned Single Judge could not have forced the parties to reach to an agreement and nearly Rs. 26,000/- spent for finding out valuation of the shares could not have been just for fun. The Division Bench dismissed the appeal with costs.

3. On hearing the parties we find that the same contention which was raised by the Appellant before the Division Bench has been reiterated. We also find no merit in the contentions. There is no infirmity factual or legal in the order of the Division Bench to warrant interference. The appeal is dismissed with cost of Rs. 25,000/-.

2. The claimants in this case have filed this appeal for compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') assailing the judgments of the High Court of Karnataka in M.F.A. No. 4537 of 1999 (MVC) alongwith cross appeal No. 26/2000 (MVC) in which the compensation awarded by the motor accident claims tribunal has been reduced from Rs. 5,42,000/- to Rs. 3,15,000/-.

3. Dhanurjaya Suna, the victim of the accident was aged about 32 years on the date of the accident i.e. 11.8.1997, He was a gas cutter in M/s. Jindal Vijayanagar Steel at Sandur Taluka, in Bellary district of the State of Karnataka. He was drawing a salary of Rs. 2015/- per month and including the overtime allowance his monthly income was about Rs. 4,000/-. The tribunal, for the purpose of determination of compensation had taken the monthly income of the deceased as Rs. 4,000/-, had applied the multiplier 15 and awarded a sum of Rs. 5,42,000/- as compensation. The High Court on appeal by the owner and insurer of the vehicle, excluded the overtime allowance from the monthly income and determined net income of the deceased at Rs. 1,515/- per month and maintained the multiplier 15 as fixed by the tribunal. The total compensation amount payable to the claimants was determined as Rs. 3,15,0007-. Both the tribunal and the High Court awarded 6% interest per annum on the compensation from the date of making the claim till the date of realization.

4. By the order passed on 3.9.2001 this Court issued notice, to the respondents limited to the question of appropriate multiplier to be applied in the case. Therefore, learned counsel for the parties confined their submissions to the question of appropriate multiplier and the rate of interest on the compensation awarded.

5. Ms. Kiran Suri, learned counsel for the appellant contended that 17 should have been taken as the appropriate multiplier in the case as that is the multiplier prescribed under the second schedule to the Act. Her further contention is that neither the tribunal nor the High Court has given any reason why the multiplier of 17 could not be accepted as the appropriate multiplier, and instead 15 should be taken as the multiplier applicable in the case. The further contention of Ms. Suri is that the rate of interest awarded in all such cases under the Motor Vehicles Act is 9% per annum and here also no reason has been stated in the award and the judgment as to why it should be reduced to 6% per annum in this case.

6. Learned counsel appearing for the respondent, insurance company, fairly stated that according to the age of the deceased as found by the tribunal, the multiplier of 17 is to be applied as provided in the second schedule to the Act. It is not disputed that though the second schedule to the Act in terms does not apply in the case since the claim is not made under Section 163A of the Act, it serves as a guideline for the purpose of determination of compensation under Section 166 of the Act.

7. On consideration of the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of the judgment of the tribunal and the High Court, we find ample substance in the contention raised by Ms. Suri that no reason has been stated by the tribunal or the High Court for fixing the 15 as multiplier. While considering the question of just compensation payable in a case all relevant factors including the appropriate multiplier are to be kept in mind. The position is well settled that the second schedule under Section 163A to the Act which gives the amount of compensation to be determined for the purpose of claim under the section can be taken as a guideline while determining the compensation under Section 166 of the Act. In that view of the matter, there is no reason why multiplier of 17 should not be taken as the appropriate multiplier in the case.

8. Coming to the question of interest this Court in the case of Kaushnuma Begum (Smt.) and Ors. v. New India Assurance Co. Ltd, and Ors. reported in MANU/SC/0002/2001MANU/SC/0002/2001 : [2001]1SCR8 observed that 9% is the appropriate rate of interest to be awarded and that rate is being applied in motor accident compensation cases.

9. Therefore, the claimants will be entitled to the compensation applying 17 as the multiplier and interest at the rate of 9% per annum will be paid on the sum so calculated from the date of filing of the claim petition till realisation. The order of the tribunal and the judgment of the High Court are modified to the extent as above.

10. The appeal is disposed of accordingly. There shall be no order as to costs.

2. The appellant, having initially succeeded partially before a learned Single Judge but lost before a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court in W.A. No.1378 and 1103 of 1998 has filed the above appeals. The appellant was appointed as clerk/typist in the service of the respondent-bank on 28.2.1972. She undertook written test for promotion to officer -- Junior Management Grade (Group A & B) on 20.7.80. Having come out successful, as per the procedure required she appeared for an interview on 27.11.80 and though according to her claim she fared well she was not included in the final list of 180 employees selected for promotion. The appellant filed O.P. No. 1323 of 1981 challenging her non-selection for promotion, questioning also incidentally the provision in the promotion policy which required the candidates to get at least a minimum of 6 1/2 qualifying marks, in the interview. The learned Single Judge, by his order dated 1.8.83 held that such predominance cannot be given to the interview by stipulating for a minimum qualifying marks of 6 1/2 to be secured in the interview and allowed the petition in the following terms:

""In moulding relief in this case, I think it would be unjust at this distance of time to quash the whole selections. Persons who have not approached the court in time would not be entitle to any relief and therefore interest of justice would be served if I direct that the petitioner also be selected if the aggregate total marks she has obtained both in the written and oral tests exceeds that of any one who is now selected. It has to be proceeded on the basis that there is no qualifying minimum marks fixed for the interview. In the matter of seniority among those selected etc. the petitioner on the basis of this order should be given consequential benefits if she is selected. Order accordingly. Original petition is allowed as above. There will be no order as to costs.""

3. On appeal by the bank, the Division Bench also seems to have affirmed the same by its judgment dated 29.11.83, and the same was said to have been reported also in I.L.R. (1964) Ker.135.

4. Thereupon, the Bank pursued the matter further before this Court in C.A. No. 1056 of 1984, and this Court by an order dated 5.8.93 while following the earlier decisions upholding the provisions prescribing minimum marks for interview in a selection, held that the requirement of 6 1/2 marks for qualifying in the viva voce, as prescribed in the promotion policy of the Bank cannot be held to be invalid and the judgment of the High Court taking the contrary view, cannot be upheld. At the same time, keeping in view the lapse of time due to the pendency of the appeal in this Court and the fact that the appellant herein also did not appear in subsequent tests held as follows:

""We, however, cannot lose sight of the fact that in view of the decision of the High Court in her favour whereby it has been elected that the respondent should be treated as selected if the aggregate total marks both in written and oral tests exceed that of anyone who is now selected, the respondent did not appear in subsequent tests. She should not be made to suffer on account of the pendency of the appeal in this Court for more than 10 years. We, therefore, consider it appropriate in the interest of justice to direct that the decision of this Court reversing the view of the High Court with regard to the validity of requirement of minimum marks for qualifying in viva-voce should not operate to the prejudice of the respondent and she should be given the benefit of the decision of the High Court. Before we part with this case it may also be mentioned that the learned counsel for the respondent has pointed out that the requirement of 33 marks for viva-voce is not in consonance with the norms laid down by this Court for the marks to be prescribed for viva-voce and for written test in a selection. Since we have not disturbed the decisions of the High Court in so far as the respondent is concerned we do not propose to go into this question. It is left to the Bank, if so advised, to take necessary steps and review its promotion policy in the light of the decision of this Court.

The appeal is allowed and the judgment of the High Court quashing that requirement of the minimum marks for qualifying in viva-voce in the promotion policy of the Bank, is set aside subject to the direction that in so far as the respondent is concerned she would be given the benefit of the judgment of the High Court. No order as to costs.""

5. The Bank promoted the appellant to the cadre of JMG-I, with retrospective effect from 30.12.80, and her seniority also seems to have been fixed, accordingly, while at the same time fixing notionally and revising her pay scales as on 5.8.93 at Rs. 3900/-, indicating also that the annual increment will fall due on 1.2.94 and thereafter on the first of February every year. But, the appellant wanted also arrears of salary, for all such period and seeking such relief filed O.P.No. 9673 of 1994. A learned Single Judge by his order dated 30.3.98 held that she would be entitled to get the full salary from 1980 onwards and further observed, ""Therefore, while calculating and disbursing the salary due to the petitioner for the above period, allowances must be made in the salary which the petitioner drew after getting the promotion in 1980."" The Bank was directed to pass orders in this regard within one month from the date of receipt of the copy of the order.

6. Aggrieved the Bank filed W.A. No. 1378 of 1998. The appellant, aggrieved by non-award of interest on the arrears directed to be paid, filed W.A. No. 1103 of 1998. The Division Bench allowed the appeal filed by the Bank and dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant, observing that the case on hand is one to which, the principles of ""no work, no pay"" can be legitimately pressed into service and the employer-Bank was justified in declining to pay the full salary for the period in respect of which notional promotion and revision of pay scales was also made. Hence, this appeal.

7. The respective learned senior counsel on either side, reiterated the stand taken before the High Court. On a careful consideration of the entire materials on record including the earlier decision of this Court in the very matter between parties, we are unable to approve the reasoning of the learned Single Judge, which is the sheet anchor of the submission for the appellant before us, besides placing reliance upon the decisions reported in Union of India and Anr. v. P. Sathikumarana Nair and Ors. MANU/SC/0590/1997MANU/SC/0590/1997 : [1997]3SCR1076 and State Bank of India and Ors. v. T.J. Paul MANU/SC/0313/1999MANU/SC/0313/1999 : (1999)IILLJ514SC . Even on a cursory glance of the decision in MANU/SC/0590/1997MANU/SC/0590/1997 : [1997]3SCR1076 (supra) it could be seen no principle of law for any guidance or to operate as any precedent seem to be laid down therein and relief was granted for the reason that there was no valid justification to deny a particular scale to a few only based on geographical location of the institutions in which they served and therefore it has no relevance at all to the issue raised in this case. The decision in MANU/SC/0313/1999MANU/SC/0313/1999 : (1999)IILLJ514SC (supra) dealt with a case of penalty of removal imposed on the employee concerned and on such punishment being found to be ultra vires, the powers of the authority and the court remitting the case for consideration of the appellate Authority for imposition of any punishment lesser than the loss of job. This case cannot be of any assistance to the issue raised in this case.

8. In State of Haryana and Ors. v. O.P. Gupta and Ors. MANU/SC/0762/1996MANU/SC/0762/1996 : [1996]1SCR468 , this Court had an occasion to deal with a claim for arrears, in a case where in adjudicating a dispute relating to seniority this Court directed the department concerned to prepare a fresh seniority list strictly in accordance with rules ignoring inconsistent administrative instructions and in compliance thereof a fresh seniority list came to be prepared and eligible persons were even given notional promotion by the department from a deemed date. When such promotees claimed for payment of arrears of salary as well, this Court rejected the claim applying the principle of 'No work, No pay' and set aside the orders of the High Court, countenancing such claims, to be illegal for the reason that the promotees did not work for the period in the promoted capacities. In coming to such conclusions this Court followed the earlier decisions reported in Paluru Ramakrishnaiah v. Union of India and Virender Kumar, G.M., N. Rlys. v. Avinash Chandra Chadha MANU/SC/0214/1991MANU/SC/0214/1991 : [1990]2SCR769 .

9. So far as the case on hand is concerned, the appellant was denied promotion in terms of the promotion policy under which it was necessary for a candidate to secure at least a minimum eligibility mark or 6 1/2 at the interview and the learned Single Judge, allowed the claim only on the ground that such prescription of a minimum mark was not valid. Though, the Division Bench also affirmed the same, this Court overruled the said decision and upheld such prescription. But taking into account the pendency of the appeal in this Court for considerable time, and on account of which the appellant also did not appear in the subsequent tests, benefit to promote her was not denied. The fact that her non-promotion was legal and there has been no unlawful interference with her right to promotion or to serve in the promoted category was obvious and could not be minced over or completely ignored in the light of the judgment of this Court, allowing the appeal by the Bank. While that be the position, the grant of relief to her, keeping in view the, delay merely due to pendency of proceedings before court, was more in the nature of a gesture of gratis and not by way of any right, to which she was found to be entitled to. Consequently, the notional promotion given to her by the Bank with suitable revision of her pay scales itself is more than sufficient to meet the requirements, be it either in law or in equity. The further claim for payment of arrears as well, is far fetched and can have no basis in law. The Division Bench, in our view, properly approached the question in the light of the relevant guiding principles and the same could not be said to be either arbitrary, unreasonable or unsound in law to warrant of our interference.

10. The appeals, in the light of the above conclusions, fail and shall stand dismissed. No costs.

1. Food Corporation of India (for short ""the Corporation"") has filed this appeal against the Division Bench judgment and order of the High Court of Calcutta whereby and where under the High Court has upheld the award made by the arbitrator appointed under the directions of the Court.

Facts:

2. Respondent was appointed as a handling and transport contractor on 14th June, 1979. On 4th January, 1980 respondent addressed a letter to the Managing Director of the Corporation requesting him to refer the disputes which had arisen between the parties for arbitration. Since no arbitrator was appointed to resolve the dispute, he filed an application under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 (for short ""the Act"") in the High Court on the original side, with a prayer to issue a direction to the Managing Director of the Corporation to appoint an arbitrator in terms of the arbitration Clause XX of the agreement entered between the parties. Court by its Order dated 16th June, 1988 issued a direction to the Managing Director of the Corporation to appoint an arbitrator in terms of Clause XX of the agreement within six weeks from the date of communication of the order. The direction was given in the following terms:

""Court Order in terms of prayer (a) of the petition. The Managing Director, Food Corporation of India is directed to appoint an arbitrator in terms of Clause 20 of the agreement within six weeks from the date of communication of the order. All disputes in the petition particularly the disputes mentioned in para 24 thereof be referred to the Arbitrator to the appointed by the Managing Director.

Let it appear marked to be mentioned 8 weeks hence.

All parties including Managing Director, Food Corporation of India and the proposed Arbitrator to act on a signed copy of the minutes of the Order on the usual undertaking.""

3. The relevant portion of the Clause XX is as under:

""All disputes and difference arising out of or in any way touching or concerning this agreement whatsoever (except as to any matter the decision of which is expressly provided for in the contract) shall be referred to the sole arbitration of any person appointed by the Managing Director of the Food Corporation of India. It will be no objection to any such appointment that the person appointed is or was an employee of the Corporation that he had to deal with the matters to which the contract related and that in the course of his duties as such employee of the Corporation he had expressed views on all or any of the matter in dispute or difference. The award of such arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties to this contract. It is a term of this contract that in event of such arbitrator to whom the matter is originally referred being transferred on vacating his office or dying or being unable to act for any reason. Managing Director of the Food Corporation of India at the time of such transfer, vacation of office, death or inability to act shall appoint another person to act as arbitrator. Such person shall be entitled to proceed with the reference from the stage at which it was left by his predecessor. It is also a term of this contract that no person other than a person appointed as aforesaid should act as arbitrator and if for any reason that is not possible the matter is not to be referred to arbitration at all.""

4. Under this clause all disputes and differences arising out of or in any way concerning the agreement whatsoever were to be referred to the sole arbitration of a person appointed by the Managing Director except as to any matter the decision of which was expressly provided for in the contract. Clause XII enumerates the items excluded from the purview of Clause XX. Relevant Sub-clauses (a), (d) and (e) of Clause XII are as under:

""(a) The contractors shall be liable for all costs, damages, demurrages, wharfage charges and expenses suffered to incurred by the Corporation due to the contractors negligence and unworkman like performance of any service under this contract or breach of any terms thereof or their failure to carry out work with a view to avoid incurrence of demurrage etc. and for all damages or losses occasioned to the Corporation or in particular to any property or plant belonging to the Corporation due to any act whether negligent or otherwise of the contractors themselves or their employees. The decision of the Sr. Regional Manager regarding such failure of the contractors and their liability of the losses etc. suffered by Corporation shall be final and binding on the contractors.

They shall provide tarpaulin on the decks of the trucks so as to avoid loss of grain etc. through the holes crevices in the decks of the trucks. They shall deliver at the destination the number of bags and the weight of food grains etc. received by them and loaded on their trucks and shall be liable to make good the value of any loss, shortage or damage in transit. The Regional Manager will be sole Judge for determining after taking into consideration all the relevant circumstances, the quantum and value of loss and also as regards the liability of the contractors for such loss and the amount to be recovered from them. The decision of the Regional manager in this regard shall be final and binding on the contractors.

(e) In case of loss, shortage, damage, pilferage, mis-appropriation (including missing of lorry loaded with consignments) to foodgrains/sugar fertilisers and gunnies during transit, the Regional Manager shall have the right, without prejudice to other rights and remedies under this contract, to impose upon and recover from the contractors an amount not exceeding three times (3 times) the issue rates of the foodgrains sugar/fertilisers applicable at the time of occurrence of such pilferage/mis- appropriation and one time (1 time) value of the gunnies. The decision of the Regional Managers in this regard shall be final and binding on the contractors.""

5. Respondent raised certain claims on the basis of which the following issues were framed. Corporation also claimed a sum of Rs. 5,62,522.70 p. on account of payment made towards demurrage and wharfage charges. Based on the claim of the contending parties the arbitrator framed the following issues:

1. Is the claim of the claimant barred by limitation?

2. Is the claimant entitled to a sum of Rs. 6,71,903. 59 paise towards handling and transport bills or to any part thereof?

3. Is the claimant entitled to get refund of Rs. 67,149,65 paise deducted for transit loss?

4. Is the claimant entitled to refund of Rs. 89,743,34 paise deducted for other purposes?

5. Is the claimant entitled to refund of Rs. 1,68,500/- deducted on account of demurrage and wharfage charges?

6. Is he claimant entitled to Rs. 1,92,873.10 paise towards price of wheat and rice delivered in excess to the respondent?

7. Is the claimant entitled to Rs. 3,21,870/- for running of trucks empty from Howrah siding to Howrah I and Howrah II for empty tare?

8. Is the FCI entitled to Rs. 5,61,522.70 paise on account of payment made towards demurrage and wharfage charges?

9. Is the claimant entitled to interest @ 18% per annum from the respective due dates of the bills till payment on the awarded sums?

6. Claim made by the Corporation for the sum of Rs. 5,62,522.70 p. was rejected. The sole arbitrator by a speaking and detailed order gave the award in the following terms:

""HELD that the claimant is entitled to a sum of Rs. 4,87,318.54 paise (Four lakhs fifty seven thousand and three hundred eighteen rupees and paise fifty four) only from the respondent on account of handling and transport bills, and refund of Rs. 67,149.65 paise (Sixty seven thousand one hundred forty nine rupees and paise sixty five) only deducted by the respondent from the claimant's pending bills towards transit loss and refund of Rs. 1,68,500/- (One lakh sixty eight thousand five hundred rupees) only deducted by the respondent from the claimant's pending bills on account of demurrage and wharfage charges. The claimant will be entitled to claim interest before the Hon'ble Court on the sum awarded from the date of publication of the award till such time as the Hon'ble Court will deem fit and proper.""

7. Corporation being aggrieved filed objections against the award before the High Court which were rejected. Contention of the Corporation that the arbitrator could not make an award regarding item which was specifically excluded from the purview of arbitration Clause XX and that by doing so the arbitrator had acted in excess of his jurisdiction to that extent was rejected. Other contentions raised by the Corporation were also rejected.

8. Aggrieved against the order of the High Court the present appeal has been filed. Counsel appearing for the Corporation relying upon the judgment of this Court in Rajasthan State Mines & Minerals Ltd. v. Eastern Engineering Enterprises and Anr., MANU/SC/0601/1999MANU/SC/0601/1999 : AIR1999SC3627 , contended that the arbitrator acted in excess of his jurisdiction in entering upon a dispute and making an award of a claim which was not permitted to be referred to the arbitrator under the contract. According to him, the claim made and given by the arbitrator under issue Nos. 3 and 5 regarding transit loss and demurrage and wharfage charges could not be made as the same had been specifically excluded under Clause XX read with Clause XII of the agreement. We find substance in this submission. Arbitration Clause XX provided that all disputes and differences arising out of or in any way touching or concerning the agreement whatsoever could be referred to the sole arbitration of a person appointed by the Managing Director except ""as to any matter the decision of which is expressly provided for in the contract"". Clause XII of the agreement provided that the contractor would be liable for all costs, damages, demurrages, wharfage charges and expenses etc. or transit loss suffered by the Corporation and the Sr. Regional Manager shall be the sole authority to determine the said failures on the part of the contractors or the loss caused thereby, thus excluding the reference to the arbitrator for the decision of these disputes. This Court in Rajasthan State Mines & Minerals Ltd. Case (supra) has held:

""(f) To find out whether the arbitrator has travelled beyond his jurisdiction, it would be necessary to consider the agreement between the parties containing the arbitration clause. The arbitrator acting beyond his jurisdiction is a different ground from the error apparent on the face of the award.

(g) In order to determine whether the arbitrator has acted in excess of his jurisdiction what has to be seen is whether the claimant could raise a particular claim before the arbitrator. If there is a specific term in the contract or the law which does not permit or give the arbitrator the power to decide the dispute raised by the claimant or there is a specific bar in the contract to the raising of the particular claim then the award passed by the arbitrator in respect thereof would be in excess of jurisdiction.""

9. High Court issued a direction by order dated 16th June, 1988 referring the disputes for arbitration in terms of Clause XX. The matters which were excluded from the reference to the arbitrator therefore could not be referred to or decided by the arbitrator. Entrance of reference by the arbitrator on disputes which were excluded from reference and the adjudication thereupon would amount to exceeding in the exercise of the jurisdiction as held by this Court in Rajasthan State Mines & Minerals Ltd. Case (supra). Since there was a specific bar to the raising of a claim regarding transit, demurrage and wharfage charges, the award made by the arbitrator in respect thereof would be in excess of the jurisdiction.

10. Accordingly, the appeal is partly allowed. Order of the High Court confirming the award regarding the aforesaid two amounts as well, is set aside. Award of the arbitrator on issues 3 and 5 relating to the refund of Rs. 67,149.65 paise towards the transit loss and the refund of Rs. 1,68,500/- towards demurrage and wharfage charges is set aside. Corporation would not be liable to pay these amounts. There is no infirmity in the award regarding other claims made by the respondents. There shall be no order as to costs.

Pinaki Chandra Ghose, J.

1. The present set of appeals arise out of the common judgment and order dated 7.02.2007 of the High Court of Judicature of Patna in Criminal Appeal Nos. 396, 405, 407 and 421 of 2003, whereby the High Court reversed the Trial Courts judgments and acquitted all the nine accused persons in this case. Earlier the 5th Additional Sessions Judge, Vaishali at Hajipur, being the Trial Court in the present matter, had convicted nine accused persons for the offence Under Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, and sentenced them to rigorous imprisonment for ten years.

2. Before venturing into the facts of the case it would be expedient to mention the names of the persons involved in this case which are as follows:

Deceased: Raj Banshi Devi

Accused persons:

(i) Ranjit Kumar Rai (husband of the deceased)

(ii) Janaki Devi (mother-in-law of the deceased - died during the trial of the case)

(iii) Dholan Devi (sister-in-law of the deceased)

(iv) Yogendra Rai (father-in-law of the deceased)

(v) Kailash Rai (husband of Dholan Devi)

(vi) Deobanti Devi (sister of Ranjit Kumar)

(vii) Ram Shresth Rai (husband of Deobanti Devi)

(viii) Sarita Kumari (alleged second wife of Ranjit Kumar)

(ix) Bishnudeo Rai (father of Sarita Kumari)

(x) Binda Rai (close relation of Bishnudeo Rai)

Prosecution witnesses:

Mishri Lal

Awadhesh Kumar

Munsi Lal

Mahendra Rai

Basisth Narayan Yadav (brother of the deceased)

3. The facts as per the prosecution story are that Raj Banshi Devi (now deceased) was married to Ranjit Kumar on 28.06.1987. Within 5 months of marriage, the in-laws of the deceased started torturing her and making dowry demands of a Rajdoot Motorcycle and a Television. Allegedly, the deceased was also threatened to be assaulted and killed and she was told that Ranjit Kumar would marry somebody else. The informant Basisth Narayan has stated that whenever he visited the deceased she informed him of the harassment that she suffered at the hands of her in-laws. He took her sister back to her parental home in December 1987 on her insistence since she feared of being killed. Later on, learning that Ranjit Kumar was going to marry one Sarita Kumari daughter of Bishnudeo Rai, Basisth Narayan took his sister, now deceased, to her matrimonial home on 24-06-1988. The deceased was allegedly beaten up and turned out of home by her in-laws. She again went to her matrimonial home on 01-07-1988. However, she was again badly assaulted and beaten up for not fulfilling the dowry demands on 17.07.1988. After this incident the deceased had filed a complaint before the Chief judicial Magistrate, Vaishali, against the accused persons Under Sections 498A, 494 of Indian Penal Code and Sections 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act. It is the further case of the prosecution that in October, 1988, the accused persons called Basisth Narayan to their house and made explicit demands of a Rajdoot Motorcycle and a Television and threatened him of facing the death of his sister. On 30.07.1989 in the morning, Basisth Narayan (the informant) received the news of his sister's death and he went to her matrimonial house where he found her sister died of burn injuries. He filed an FIR and the police conducted investigation thereupon.

4. During the trial, the prosecution produced 5 witnesses out of 11 persons named in the charge-sheet. It appears that prosecution missed out to examine either parents of the deceased and curiously, two persons being Bir Bahadur Rai and Chandeshwar Rai, who were cited as prosecution witnesses in the charge-sheet, were produced as Defence Witnesses. If this was not enough to show poor way of conducting the prosecution, there is another strikingly disturbing fact that neither the doctor who conducted post-mortem nor the investigating officer was brought on record as witness.

5. PW-1 Mishri Lal appears to be a hearsay witness as he says that he was told by one Triloki Sharma that the ten accused persons had beaten up the deceased and set her on fire. Even PW2 Awadhesh Rai says that he had gone to Triloki Sharma's house on the date of incident i.e. 30.07.1989 when Triloki Sharma told him that the accused persons had beaten up the deceased and that she was killed. He further states that he had seen the dead body of the deceased and it had scars all over the body and both the knees were tied up with iron wire.

6. The testimony of the informant Basisth Narayan (PW-5) is vital one as he is the brother of the deceased. He has stated that the incident occurred on the night intervening 29.07.1989 and 30.07.1989. He received the information of death of his sister in the morning of 30.07.1989 and went to her place. He found large assemblage of people outside the house. On going inside the house he found the dead body of his sister which was covered with pink colour terrycot saree. On removing the saree he found both her hands were tied with iron wire and flesh of both the hands was reddish while neck also appeared to be tied with something. On enquiring from the crowd assembled outside the house he learnt that the previous night at around 9 PM, all the ten accused persons were making conversations inside the house and even sound of crying was heard. People also told him that in the morning when the accused persons were trying to dispose of the dead body, the village chowkidar had seen them, so they all fled away. He has further testified to the harassment met out with the deceased after her marriage at the hands of the accused persons. He deposed with respect to the dowry demands which we have already recorded in the alleged facts from the side of prosecution and, for the sake of brevity, we are not repeating them. He has further deposed that 21.06.1988 he had gone to Bishnudeo Rai who is the father of Sarita Kumari to whom Ranjit Kumar was rumored to marry soon. He had requested Bishnudeo Rai not to let his daughter marry Ranjit Kumar as it would ruin the life of his sister (now deceased) but it was dismissed by Bishnudeo Rai. Later he learnt that Ranjit Kumar was marrying Sarita Kumari and so he had taken his sister (now deceased) to her matrimonial house and due to this reason the marriage was postponed from 24.06.1988 to 27.06.1988.

Thereafter, it is alleged that Ranjit Kumar did marry Sarita Kumari, however, no conclusive proof is brought fore to prove this fact.

7. Apart from oral testimony, we find that there is a letter dated 09.08.1988 written in handwriting of the deceased and signature of the deceased, to her brother Basisth Narayan wherein she has expressed her fears of being killed by her in-laws if the demands of dowry were not met. She mentions in that letter about a past incident when she was given poison in her food but she threw away the food. This letter was proved by PW-5 as the one that he received from his sister. The medical evidence in this case is the post-mortem report. The post-mortem report reveals that there are numerous ante mortem injuries. Three ribs in chest are found fractured by some hard and blunt object and that there are superficial burn injuries all over the body deep at only a small portion of front neck. The cause of death as per the post-mortem report appears to be shock due to burn injuries.

8. The defence has not come up with a substantial case of its own except claiming that the deceased was not murdered but she caught fire from a stove while cooking food. The defence has contended various lacunae in the case of the prosecution. They have relied heavily on the non-examination of important witnesses in this case. But besides this, the defence has failed to explain any other circumstance surrounding the death of the deceased or the circumstances after her death.

9. We have analysed the evidence produced in this case. We find that although the case of the prosecution suffers from many infirmities and there has been unexplained reluctance in bringing the relevant witnesses on record, apart from parents of the deceased, the doctor and the Investigating Officer, even Triloki Sharma and the Chowkidar who saw the accused persons disposing of the body of the deceased, have also not been examined. Yet we may not lose sight of the fact that this is the case of dowry death. Even with the limited evidence brought on record certain things have been established. It is undisputed that the deceased had died during the night of 30.07.1989 due to burn injuries inside her matrimonial house. It further appears that when PW-5 informant arrived at the house on the day of the incident, the house was deserted except that her sister's dead body was lying. These two are extremely incriminating circumstances; as in normal course the dead body would not have been abandoned like this. Further, there are ante mortem injuries found on the body of the deceased which shows that there was some physical assault on her before she died. This is further established by the fact that her knees were tied with an iron wire even after death. We find this indicates that the deceased was not only physically assaulted which caused her three ribs to fracture but she was also tied up with iron wire so as to make her immobile and thereafter she was set on fire. The demands of dowry are proved sufficiently by PW-5 and the letter that the deceased had written to PW-5, clearly shows that the demands of dowry were not only made but even cruelty in relation to those demands was committed. The deceased had expressed in the letter her apprehension of being killed. The complaint to the Chief Judicial Magistrate Under Sections 494, 498A of Indian Penal Code and Sections 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act, goes on to further indicate that dowry related cruelty was committed against the deceased. The deceased was married to accused Ranjit Kumar on 26.06.1987 which means the death of the deceased occurred within a little over 2 years of the marriage. We find that the three main ingredients of Section 304B of Indian Penal Code have been proved to trigger the presumption Under Section 113B of the Evidence Act, 1872. The death has occurred within 7 years of the marriage due to burn injuries and there were demands of dowry accompanied with the physical and mental cruelty against the deceased prior to her death. The post-mortem report has revealed the physical assault on her just before her death. Therefore, we find that the burden of proof must shift on the accused persons to explain the death of the deceased. The defence has made a cursory statement that the deceased caught fire from stove while cooking food. There is no explanation as to why the deceased was not taken to hospital or why was the dead body left unattended to in the morning. The entire conduct of the accused persons is very suspicious and non-explanation of same means they have not discharged their burden of proof.

10. However, we must focus our attention to the fact that there are ten accused persons in this case (one of them died during the pendency of trial) and it has not been proved conclusively or even sufficiently that all of the accused were present in the house when the deceased died. Since we are proceeding on a presumption we must be cautious in attaching the guilt to the accused persons whose presence itself can be doubted at the place of incident. In the present case, Sarita Kumari, her father Bishnudeo Rai and Binda Rai are not members of this family and they had no reason to be present at the house of Ranjit Kumar when the deceased died due to burn injuries. Similar is the case of Dholan Devi and Deobanti Devi (sisters of Ranjit Kumar) and their husbands Kailash Rai and Ram Shrestha Rai. Those persons did not use to live in the house of Ranjit Kumar and they used to stay in a different village. There is no evidence to the effect that these accused persons were in that house when the incident occurred. Therefore, we do not find it prudent to attach guilt to them in absence of any such evidence.

11. With respect to the other accused persons i.e. Ranjit Rai and his father Yogendra Rai, who were ordinarily residents in the house where the deceased died of burn injuries, neither of the two accused persons has offered any reasonable explanation as to how did the deceased suffer the ante mortem injuries and died due to burn injuries. In these circumstances, we find the two accused persons, being Ranjit Rai and Yogendra Rai, as guilty for commission of crime. Accordingly, the judgment and order of the Trial Court, so far as it convicted and sentenced Ranjit Rai and Yogendra Rai, is restored and the appeals are allowed to this extent. Ranjit Rai and Yogendra Rai shall be taken into custody forthwith to serve out the sentence.

12. Hon'ble Mr. Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghose pronounced the reportable judgment of the Bench comprising His Lordship and Hon'ble Mr. Justice Uday Umesh Lalit.

13. The appeals are allowed in terms of the signed reportable judgment as follows:

Accordingly, the judgment and order of the Trial Court, so far as it convicted and sentenced Ranjit Kumar and Yogendra Rai, is restored and the appeals are allowed to this extent. Ranjit Kumar and Yogendra Rai shall be taken into custody forthwith to serve out the sentence.

Vikramajit Sen, J.

1. This Appeal assails the judgment dated 19.4.2006 of the Securities Appellate Tribunal which upheld the order of the Securities and Exchange Board of India dated 1.8.2003. The factual matrix is that one Mr. V.P. Garg (hereinafter referred to as 'Garg') entered into an 'Assisted Sector Agreement' with the Haryana State Industrial Development Corporation Limited (hereinafter referred to as 'HSIDC') on 4.1.1993, for the purpose of setting up a modern resort hotel complex at Village Chowky, Tehsil Kalka, Haryana. The parties agreed to collaborate for the profitable implementation and operation of the project in the assisted sector through a company already incorporated by Garg under the name and style of Polo Hotels Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the 'Target Company'). HSIDC extended a term loan to Garg and also subscribed to 3,00,000 shares of Rs. 10/- each of the Target Company. Clause 24 of the Agreement provided for buy-back of the shares of HSIDC. The said clause is reproduced for facility of reference:

BUY BACK ARRANGEMENT:

24. (a) At any time after the Company goes in for commercial production, the Corporation may with the consent of the Collaborator offload its shareholding in the Company partially or fully in such manner as it may deem fit. The Collaborator will however have the pre-emptive right to buy the shareholding of the Corporation. Similarly, after the shares of the Company are duly listed on the Stock Exchange/DTCET, and with the consent of the Corporation, the Collaborator may buy its shareholding at a mutually agreed price which shall be equal to or higher than that provided Under Sub-clause (c).

(b) After expiry of five years from the date of commencement of commercial production by the Company or at the expiry of seven years from the date of its incorporation whichever is earlier, the Collaborator shall be bound to purchase the Equity share holding of the Corporation in the Company. Provided that the Corporation may at its discretion retain the shares acquired by it through over subscription or rights issue or bonus shares.

(c) On buy back of shareholding of the Corporation by the Collaborator under Sub-clause (b), the price to be paid shall be highest of the:

i) Issue price of the share plus simple interest for the period at the lowest normal lending rate of interest on term loans under refinance scheme of IDBI prevailing at the time of first issue of shares to the Corporation under its agreement. OR

ii) The highest price of the shares ruling on any Indian Stock Exchanges for a period of two months preceding the date on which the Collaborator ought to purchase the shares held by the Corporation as provided in Clause (b) above. OR

iii) Assessed value of the shares as determined by the Auditors of the Company on the basis of net worth, of the Company on the date of sale of the shares.

2. Garg defaulted in repayment of loan as well as in buying back the shares of HSIDC in the Target Company. In March 1999, Garg entered into an agreement with Mr. A.R. Dahiya (the 'Appellant') for the sale of Garg's entire shareholding of 28.09% in the Target Company. This agreement was subject to the approval of HSIDC and contained a clause that Garg would be absolved of fulfilling the buy-back obligation, provided HSIDC agreed to accept the Appellant in place of Garg. Garg wrote a letter to HSIDC dated 31.3.1999 stating that on account of his deteriorating financial condition, he had decided to transfer his equity shareholding in the Target Company to the Appellant and that the Appellant had agreed to furnish his personal guarantee for buy-back of the three lac equity shares held by HSIDC. In the letter Garg requested HSIDC to accept the personal guarantee of the Appellant in lieu of his buy-back guarantee and to absolve him from the obligation.

3. The Appellant also wrote a letter to HSIDC dated 15.4.1999, informing it that he and Garg had entered into an agreement for purchase of equity shareholding of Garg and for complete takeover of the management of the Target Company. The Appellant confirmed that he was prepared to buy-back the equity holding of HSIDC as provided for in the assisted sector agreement instead of Garg, under similar terms and conditions. The Appellant also requested that since he was facing a stringent liquidity problem, the payment for the buy-back which was due in April 1999 be instead made in monthly installments of Rs. 20 lacs each with effect from September 1999. Enclosed with the letter were four post-dated cheques in respect of the said buy-back obligations, amounting to a total of Rs. 71,25,466/-. HSIDC, vide its letter dated 19.4.1999 to Garg, accepted the joint request made by him and the Appellant. Subsequently, the Appellant, Garg and HSIDC entered into a tripartite financial collaboration agreement, whereby HSIDC consented to the Appellant stepping into the shoes of Garg.

4. On 20.4.1999, Garg and the Appellant entered into an agreement whereby the Appellant agreed to purchase the entire share capital of 28.09% held by Garg at the rate of Rs. 8.50 per fully paid up equity share. Since this acquisition was in excess of 15% of the total shareholding of the Target Company, the Regulations under the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997, were attracted. In order to comply with the Regulations, the Appellant made a public announcement on 24.4.1999 making an offer to the remaining shareholders of the Target Company to purchase a minimum of 20% shares of the said company at an offer price of Rs. 8.75 per equity share.

5. On 5.5.1999, a draft letter of offer was sent by the merchant banker of the Appellant to SEBI for its approval. Neither in the public announcement nor in the letter did the Appellant disclose the fact that he and his associates had already bought back the shares of HSIDC. SEBI reverted with a letter dated 26.5.1999 seeking clarifications from the merchant banker of the Appellant. The letter stated that the price at which the Appellant proposed to acquire the shares from HSIDC as per the agreement dated 19.4.1999, had to be calculated and specified upfront in the offer document. Further, if the price payable to HSIDC as per the said agreement was higher than the present offer price of Rs. 8.75 per share, then the offer price must be justified as required Under Regulation 20(6). The draft letter of offer dated 5.5.1999 was approved by the SEBI subject to certain changes vide its communication dated 30.9.1999. As it transpired in response to the public announcement, the Appellant could acquire only 2.42% of the shares of the Target Company, as the shareholders were not willing to offer their shares at Rs. 8.75 when their face value was Rs. 10/-.

6. SEBI received a complaint from Mr. Komlam Sardana alleging that the Appellant had acquired three lac equity shares from HSIDC for Rs. 71,25,466/- at the rate of Rs. 23.75 per share, whereas the shares were not offered at the same price to the existing shareholders. The complainant alleged that the Appellant was suffering from a liquidity crunch and had requested HSIDC to receive the consideration amount with respect to the transfer of shares in monthly installments. The complainant also brought to the notice of SEBI that the post-dated cheques through which the Appellant had tendered consideration had subsequently been dishonoured and criminal proceedings had been initiated against him. A copy of the said complaint was forwarded to the Appellant through his merchant banker.

7. The Appellant moved an application on 2.12.1999 stating that he was covered under the ambit of Regulation 3(1)(i), and as a result was immune to the provisions Under Regulations 10, 11 and 12. The relevant provisions have been reproduced as under:

3. Applicability of the Regulation.-(1) Nothing contained in the Regulations 10, 11 and 12 of these Regulations shall apply to:

xxx

(i) transfer of shares from state level financial institutions, including their subsidiaries to co-promoter(s) of the company pursuant to an agreement between such financial institution and such co-promoter(s);

12. Acquisition of control over a company.-Irrespective of whether or not there has been any acquisition of shares or voting rights in a company, no acquirer shall acquire control over the Target Company, unless such person makes a public announcement to acquire shares and acquires such shares in accordance with the Regulations:

Provided that nothing contained herein shall apply to any change in control which takes place in pursuance to a resolution passed by the shareholders in a general meeting.

SEBI sought a clarification from the merchant banker on 29.2.2000, regarding the non-disclosure of the payment of Rs. 71,25,466/- by the Appellant through postdated cheques. The merchant banker in its letter dated 13.4.2000 informed SEBI that the Appellant had not informed him about the payment made through post-dated cheques. Subsequently, SEBI wrote a letter to HSIDC dated 2.6.2000 asking whether the letter dated 15.4.1999 pertained to the buy-back of shares and whether the post-dated cheques were deposited with HSIDC as security for the buy-back obligations. The HSIDC in its reply via letter dated 1.8.2000, stated that the postdated cheques had been issued towards the purchase consideration for the buy-back of three lac equity shares held by HSIDC in the Target Company. SEBI, on being satisfied that a prima facie case of non-disclosure of material facts in the public announcement and a violation of Regulations exists, issued a show cause notice to the Appellant. The Appellant filed his reply to the show cause notice after which SEBI by its order dated 1.8.2003 issued directions to the Appellant Under Section 4(3) read with Section 11B of the Act and Regulations 44 and 45 of the Regulations. The Appellant was directed to make a fresh public announcement for 20% shares as required Under Chapter 11 of the Regulations in accordance with Regulation 10 and offer to the shareholders of the Target Company the price of Rs. 23.75 per share along with interest at the rate of 15% per annum for the period from 16.11.1999 to the actual date of payment of consideration. SEBI further directed the Appellant to pay the balance amount at the aforesaid rate to all the shareholders who had offered their shares in pursuance to the public announcement dated 24.4.1999 along with interest. Aggrieved by this order, the Appellant preferred an appeal.

8. Before the Securities Appellate Tribunal the Appellant contended that the amount deposited with HSIDC via post-dated cheques was not in consideration for the buy-back of shares. Instead it was deposited by way of comfort/security for the buy-back obligation so as to demonstrate to HSIDC that the Appellant was a man of means who could buy-back the shares subsequently (an assertion which in any case stood belied by the dishonour of the cheques). The Tribunal rejected this contention by placing reliance on two letters. The first letter, issued by the Appellant on 15.4.1999, was addressed to HSIDC, where in no uncertain terms the Appellant had stated that the payment by means of post-dated cheques was in consideration for the buy-back of shares. The second letter referred to by the Tribunal was issued by HSIDC on 11.1.2001, where in its reply to SEBI's clarificatory letter, HSIDC categorically stated that the payment by the Appellant was consideration for the buy-back of the shares. The Tribunal also indicated that if the said amount had been deposited by way of comfort or security was being contended by the Appellant, then it would have been a lump sum figure and not an amount as precise as Rs. 71,25,466/-. In light of the above stated facts, it was held to be beyond doubt that the Appellant had paid the said sum as a consideration for the buy-back of shares at a rate of Rs. 23.75 per share. Thus as a necessary corollary, the said transaction had to be disclosed at the time of public announcement as provided Under Regulation 16(viii). The Tribunal observed that as the said transaction and its details were neither disclosed in the public offer nor in the letter of offer made to the other shareholders, SEBI was correct in directing the Appellant to go in for a fresh public announcement and offer to the remaining shareholders of the Target Company the rate of Rs. 23.75 per share.

9. The Appellant also contended that the said post-dated cheques had subsequently been dishonoured, hence no payment could be said to have been made in respect of the buy-back of shares. Furthermore, the shares held by HSIDC had not been transferred in the name of the Appellant or his associates, so the acquisition had not reached its stage of fruition. Resultantly, the price offered to HSIDC could not be taken into consideration as provided Under Regulation 20(2) (b) of the Regulations to determine the minimum offer price.

20. Minimum offer price.--(1) The offer to acquire the shares Under Regulation 10, 11 or 12 shall be made at a minimum offer price which shall be payable--

(a) in cash; or

(b) by exchange and/or transfer of shares of the acquirer company, if the person seeking to acquire the shares is a listed body corporate; or

(c) by exchange and/or transfer of secured instruments with a minimum of ""A"" grade rating from a credit rating agency;

(d) a combination of Clause (a), (b) or (c):

Provided that....

(2) For the purposes of Sub-Regulation (1), the minimum offer price shall be the highest of-

(a) the negotiated price under the agreement referred to in Sub-Regulation (1) of Regulation 14;

(b) the highest price paid by the acquirer or persons acting in concert with him for any acquisitions, including by way of allotment in a public or rights issue, if any, during the 26 week period prior to the date of public announcement;

(c) the price paid by the acquirer under a preferential allotment made to him or to persons acting in concert with him at any time during the twelve months period up to the date of closure of the offer;

(d) the average of the weekly high and low of the closing prices of the shares of the Target Company as quoted on the stock exchange where the shares of the company are most frequently traded during the 26 weeks preceding the date of public announcement.

Explanation....

10. The Tribunal observed that from a perusal of Regulation 20(2)(b) it was clear that the highest price paid by an acquirer for any acquisition would be taken into consideration for determining the minimum offer price. As the Appellant had paid Rs. 23.75 per share to HSIDC within the period of 26 weeks prior to the date of public announcement, this transaction had to be taken into consideration for determining the minimum offer price. The Tribunal negated the specific contention of the Appellant, finding that irrespective of whether acquisition took place or not, Regulation 20(2)(b) stood attracted as the amount was paid for the purpose of the acquisition. The Appellant contended that as his buy-back from HSIDC, was a transfer of shares from a State level financial institution to a co-promoter of the Target Company, it was exempt Under Regulation 10. Thus in turn, the same transaction need not be taken into consideration to determine the minimum offer price. The Tribunal dismissed this contention by stating that the exemption Under Regulation 10 was only with respect to making a public announcement. The said exemption does not permit the Appellant from not disclosing the transaction for the purpose of calculating the minimum offer price.

11. Aggrieved by the decision of the Tribunal, the Appellant has now filed this Appeal. Counsel for the Appellant contends that Regulation 20(2)(b) uses the expression ""acquisition"" and submits that as the said acquisition was to happen in the future, the Regulation was not applicable to him. Further, the post-dated cheques that had been deposited were given in the form of a guarantee to HSIDC. Counsel submits that the buy-back was initially due in April 1999, but was subsequently postponed till November 1999, and thus as the buy-back was to take place in November, it is then that the rate would have been calculated and determined. Reliance has been placed on a letter issued by HSIDC dated 1.6.1999 addressed to the Appellant stating that the purchase consideration of the shares under buy-back agreement could not be determined as on date, and the equity had to be bought back by the promoters at a purchase consideration which would be calculated as per the terms contained in Clause 15 of the Tripartite agreement. Counsel relies on a letter issued by HSIDC dated 9.12.1999 wherein it was communicated to the Appellant that the post-dated cheques which he had deposited were dishonoured on presentation due to non-availability of sufficient funds with the accounts, and thus as there had been no payment no acquisition had taken place. To further buttress this contention learned Counsel relied on a letter issued by HSIDC dated 11.1.2001 addressed to SEBI, wherein it was averred that the transfer of shares to the incoming collaborators would be effected only on the deposit of the entire amount of purchase consideration.

12. Learned Senior Counsel for the Respondent contends that the Regulations were triggered when the purchase was made by one promoter from another, that is by the Appellant from Garg, and not from the purchase by the Appellant from HSIDC. Evidence was placed on record to prove that the Appellant was still carrying on business of the Target Company. Counsel contended that on 31.3.1999, the Appellant agreed to step into the shoes of Garg. On 15.4.1999 HSIDC received intimation from the Appellant regarding the agreement and also received four postdated cheques amounting to Rs. 71,25,466 as consideration for the purchase of three lac equity shares in the Target Company, thus taking his share in the Target Company to 8.83%. On 19.4.1999, the Tripartite agreement between the Appellant, Garg and HSIDC was entered into. Subsequently, on 20.4.1999, the Appellant and Garg entered into an agreement as per which the Appellant purchased Garg's entire share capital of 9,54,450 shares amounting to 28.09% share in the Target Company at the rate of Rs. 8.50 per fully paid up equity share. It was this transaction which triggered Regulation 10, as there was an acquisition of more than 15% of the total shareholding of the Target Company. In order to comply with Regulation 10, the Appellant made a public announcement within four working days as prescribed in Regulation 14(1) on 24.4.1999. The rate that was being offered by the Appellant at which he would acquire shares from the public was Rs. 8.75. In response to the public announcement, the Appellant could only acquire 2.42% of the shares of the Target Company, which was not surprising as the rate at which the shares were being offered to be purchased by the Appellant was lower than the face value of the shares. Counsel relied on a letter issued by HSIDC to SEBI dated 11.1.2001, wherein it was categorically mentioned that the cheques issued by the Appellant to HSIDC were consideration for the buy-back of the shareholding held by HSIDC in the Target Company. Finally, Learned Senior Counsel places reliance on Regulation 16 which provides the contents of the public announcement, of which one of the disclosures that a company had to make is to state the highest and the average price paid by the acquirer or persons acting in concert with him for acquisition, if any, of shares of the Target Company made by him during the twelve month period prior to the date of public announcement.

13. The first issue that has to be addressed before us is whether the transaction of buy-back of shares which transpired between the Appellant and HSIDC was required to be disclosed in the public announcement dated 24.4.1999. In order to determine this requirement, we must examine the operative clauses of the relevant Regulations. Regulation 3 states that Regulations 10, 11 and 12 shall have no applicability to any transfer of shares from state level financial institutions, including their subsidiaries, to co-promoter(s) of the company pursuant to an agreement between such financial institution and such co-promoter(s). Regulations 10, 11 and 12 mandate the making of a public announcement, if any of the criteria mentioned therein are satisfied. Regulation 16 provides the contents and essential disclosures that are to be made at the time of making a public announcement. Regulation 20 establishes the method of computation to be employed in order to determine the minimum offer price which the acquirer must offer to purchase shares in a public announcement Under Regulation 10, 11 or 12. It is evident from a reading of the above Regulations that the buy-back transaction between the Appellant and HSIDC was incapable of triggering Regulation 10, as the said transaction was protected by Regulation 3. However, the acquisition of the entire share capital of Garg by the Appellant attracted Regulation 10 as the acquisition was in excess of 15%. Further, as this transaction was between two promoters, it did not have the protection of Regulation 3. As required Under Regulation 10, the Appellant did make a public announcement, but did not disclose its buy-back transaction with HSIDC. The Appellant has vainly and incorrectly attempted to justify his act of non-disclosure by stating that the transaction with HSIDC was protected by Regulation 3, which placed it beyond the ambit of Regulation 10, 11 and 12. In our view, Regulation 3 only protects a transaction between a co-promoter and a State financial institution to the extent that, as a consequence of such transaction a public announcement will not be required to be made as provided Under Regulations 10, 11 and 12. However, it does not imply that the said transaction is to be protected from the rigours of other Regulations provided for under the Act. Thus, the transaction between the Appellant and HSIDC will have to be subject to Regulations 16 and 20, and the rate at which the Appellant bought back the shares from HSIDC had to be disclosed in the public announcement.

14. We also find no force whatsoever in the contention of the learned Counsel for the Appellant that the post-dated cheques forwarded to HSIDC enclosed with letter dated 15.4.1999 were given by way of a guarantee, especially in light of the fact that the same was denied by HSIDC in its letter to SEBI dated 11.1.2001, wherein HSIDC stated that the post-dated cheques had been issued in consideration of the buy-back of shares.

15. The next contention that was raised by the Counsel for the Appellant was that as the cheques presented had been dishonoured on presentation, the said transaction did not culminate in an acquisition. It has already been held beyond doubt that the post-dated cheques issued by the Appellant in favour of HSIDC were in consideration of the buy-back of the shares held by HSIDC in the Target Company. The Appellant had submitted that the cheques were post-dated because he was suffering from a liquidity crunch. In our view, the post-dated cheques amounted to a promise to pay and that promise would be fulfilled on the date mentioned on the cheque. Thus, this promise to pay amounted to a sale of shares/equity. The subsequent dishonouring of the post-dated cheque would have no bearing on the case. At the time of making the public announcement the Appellant had bought back the shares of HSIDC by making payment via the said post-dated cheques. Further, as the buy-back was in pursuance of an agreement, there was consensus ad idem. The Appellant has subsequently shirked his responsibility and has tried to slither away from honouring the agreement, which he cannot be allowed to gain from, as is established by the legal maxim commodum ex injuri su non habere debet. While interpreting the term acquisition, we must conceptualize the intention behind these Regulations which, it seems to us, is to safeguard the shareholders from adverse consequences of acquisitions and takeovers as far as the value of the shares is concerned. Not infrequently, the new management's endeavour is to manipulate the market price of the shares in a manner calculated to induce the existing shareholders to off load their holdings at a low price. This is achieved by portraying a false picture of their value. In the background of such an intention it would fallacious to suggest that the said transaction did not tantamount to an acquisition.

16. In order to dispel doubts regarding the term 'acquisition', the same was subsequently defined in the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011. Under Regulation 2 Clause (1) Sub-clause (a)-'acquisition' means directly or indirectly acquiring or agreeing to acquire shares or voting rights in, or control over, a Target Company. This definition clarifies that an acquisition takes place the moment the acquirer decides or agrees to acquire, irrespective of the time when the transfer stands completed in all respects. The definition explicates that the actual transfer need not be contemporaneous with the intended transfer and can be in futuro.

17. Further, the letter on which the Counsel for the Appellant had placed reliance to prove that there was no acquisition, is dated 9.12.1999, which was well after the public announcement dated 24.4.1999 where the Appellant was required to make disclosures in compliance with the Regulations. This clearly indicates, that at the date of making the public announcement the Appellant was under the impression that the acquisition has taken place.

18. We neither find any merit in the appeal, nor any infirmity in the order of SEBI dated 1.8.2003. Thus Appeal is dismissed.

1 This appeal has been filed against the judgment delivered on 16th November, 2005 in R.S.A. No. 578 of 2000 by the High Court of Karnataka at Bangalore.

2. The facts giving rise to the present Appeal, in a nutshell, are as under:

The Appellant is the original Defendant in the Suit. The Plaintiffs, who are Respondents herein, had filed a Suit for partition and separate possession of the 7/8th share in the Suit property. The property in question originally belonged to late Shaikaji, whose first wife Halimabi had died and thereafter he had married Roshanbi. Out of the first marriage with Halimabi, late Shaikaji had two children and one of them had died whereas he had six children through his second marriage with Roshanbi. The Suit was filed by the second wife and her children against the Defendant, who is the heir of the first wife.

3. The Suit was in respect of property which was purchased by Shaikaji and the suit property was in occupation of all the family members.

4. The Suit, being O.S. No. 153 of 1985 was decreed on 27th July, 1988.

5. The said judgment and decree had been challenged by way of an appeal and the said appeal was dismissed on 13th November, 1995 by the first Appellate Court. Being aggrieved by the said judgment, an appeal was filed in the High Court. The High Court had allowed the appeal by remanding the matter to the first Appellate Court for its fresh disposal with a direction to permit the parties to lead documentary evidence in relation to a memorandum of partition dated 12th August, 1958.

6. In pursuance of the order of the High Court, the first Appellate Court had permitted production of the aforestated document Ex. D7 dated 12th August, 1958, which is in a nature of a memorandum of partition, whereby, during the lifetime of Shaikaji, the property in question had been divided among the children of the first wife and the second wife. In pursuance of the aforestated document, necessary revenue entries were made, whereby the property bearing CTS No. 883 was divided into CTS No. 883/A and CTS No. 883/B. The aforestated facts are not in dispute and it is also an admitted fact that the eastern part of the property, CTS No. 883/B, was in possession of the Plaintiffs i.e. the children of the second wife as well as late Shaikaji, whereas the western part of the property, CTS No. 883/A, was in occupation of the son of the first wife. The first Appellate Court considered the validity of the aforestated document dated 12th August, 1958 and came to the conclusion that the property had been divided earlier, which was recorded under a document dated 12 August, 1958, which was duly signed by late Shri Shaikaji and the document had also been attested by two independent witnesses. Unfortunately neither Shaikaji nor the attesting witnesses were alive at the time when the said document was exhibited as Ex. D7. The said document was believed by the lower Appellate Court and on the basis of the evidence which had been adduced in addition to the aforestated document, the first Appellate Court had set aside the decree passed by the Trial Court and held that the property had been divided during the lifetime of late Shaikaji and therefore, the Plaintiffs were not entitled to 7/8th share in the Suit premises which consisted of CTS No. 883/A and CTS No. 883/B. According to the lower Appellate Court, the property had been duly divided and was in occupation of the respective parties even during the lifetime of late Shaikaji.

7. The said judgment dated 1st April, 2000 delivered by the lower Appellate Court in Regular Appeal No. 75/1998 had been challenged before the High Court in Regular Second Appeal No. 578/2000, which had been allowed by the High Court and therefore, this appeal has been filed. The High Court did not agree with the view expressed by the lower Appellate Court mainly on the ground that Ex. D7 had not been registered as it ought to have been registered as it was compulsorily registrable. The High Court was also of the view that Ex. D7 was not produced at the time when the trial was conducted and the said document had not been relied upon by the Defendant at the time of the trial though he was in possession of the said document. Moreover, the High Court was of the view that there is no concept of joint family in Muslims and therefore, there could not have been any partition or joint family property among the Plaintiffs and the Defendant, who belong to the family of Shaikaji.

8. The learned Counsel appearing for the Appellant i.e. the original Defendant submitted that the High Court committed an error by not relying upon the document Ex. D7 dated 12th August, 1958. He submitted that the said document was executed by Shaikaji giving details with regard to his family and giving a portion of his property bearing No. CTS 883 to the son of his first wife and another portion of the property to the children of his second wife. Late Shaikaji had continued to stay with his second wife and children of the second wife in the property which was subsequently numbered as CTS 883/B.

9. He also submitted that division of the property among the children of two wives was duly recorded in Ex. D7, which was executed by late Shaikaji and the said document, which was presented after 30 years, was admissible as per the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act and there was no reason to disbelieve the said document. Moreover, the learned Counsel drew our attention to certain admitted facts pertaining to admission by the Plaintiffs with regard to their approaching independent persons when a dispute had been raised with regard to possession of the Suit property. There was an evidence to show that some understanding was arrived at earlier among the family members, which was reflected in Ex. D7, which was duly acted upon and therefore, it was submitted by the learned Counsel that there was no reason for the High Court to take a different view than the one which was taken by the lower Appellate Court.

10. On the other hand, the learned Counsel appearing for the Respondents/original Plaintiffs submitted that the document Ex. D7 had not been produced by the Defendant at the time of the trial though he was in possession thereof and there was no justifiable reason for not producing the said document at the time of the trial. Moreover, he submitted that the said document ought to have been registered but since it was not registered, it ought not to have been relied upon by the lower Appellate Court and the High Court was justified in ignoring the said document.

11. No other submission was made by the learned Counsel.

We have heard the learned Counsel and have perused the impugned judgment and the evidence recorded by the courts below.

12. Upon perusal of the evidence, we are of the view that the lower Appellate Court was correct in its conclusion that late Shaikaji had made arrangements with regard to his property during his lifetime and the said arrangements had been subsequently recorded in Ex. D7, which had been duly acted upon by the revenue authorities by dividing the suit property into two different parts namely, CTS No. 883/A and CTS No. 883/B. It is not in dispute that the property which had been divided by late Shaikaji was in occupation of the respective parties and the said fact has also been recorded in the revenue record.

13. It is true that there is no concept of joint family in Muslims but it was open to late Shri Shaikaji to give his property to his children in a particular manner during his lifetime, which he rightly did, so as to avoid any dispute which could have arisen after his death. The arrangement so made was duly accepted by the family members and it was also acted upon. Only thereafter a formal record of the said fact was made by late Shaikaji in Ex. D.7.

14. In our opinion, genuineness of Ex. D7 was rightly not questioned by the lower Appellate Court and the High Court was not correct when it questioned its legality and validity, especially when the Plaintiffs had filed a suit after more than 25 years of the aforestated understanding, which had taken place during or prior to 1958.

15. For the reasons stated hereinabove and more particularly those stated by the lower Appellate Court, we allow the appeal and set aside the judgment delivered by the High Court so as to give effect to the judgment and decree passed by the lower Appellate Court.

16 Thus, the appeal stands disposed of as allowed with no orders as to costs.

1. By this interlocutory application, Mr. Jose Sabastin had prayed for the following reliefs:

(i) Issue an interim direction directing to the second Respondent to give an appropriate compensation of the 1st applicants family as this Hon'ble Court deem fit as there is no other provision to protect the interest of the applicant.

(ii) Issue an interim direction by appointing a commission to go through the issues and the recent attacks of stray dogs and what medical facilities and protections providing by the Government and submit this report to the Hon'ble Court as this Hon'ble Court held in the case of Bandhua Mukthi Morcha v. Union of India reported in MANU/SC/0051/1983MANU/SC/0051/1983 : 1984 Vol. 3 SCC 161.

We have heard Mr. Biju, learned Counsel for the applicant, Mr. Basant, learned Senior Counsel for the State of Kerala and Mr. Dushyant Dave, learned Amicus Curiae in the application.

2. It is agonizingly submitted by Mr. Biju that the horror of death or grievous injury hunts the psyche of many an individual in various districts in the State of Kerala as they fall prey to the dog bites.

3. Learned Counsel should submit that there should be respect for the provisions made in Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 and the Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules, 2001 to protect the animals but that does not really mean that the human beings should become prey to the attacks of the stray dogs, for it is the obligation of the State to see that the said dogs are sterilized or from time to time dealt with in accordance with law.

4. The thrust of his submission is that because of inadequate action on the part of the State, the number of victims has arisen in the State of Kerala and it has given rise to a catastrophe, for death of number of persons has ruined the families. It is urged by him that wife of the present applicant succumbed to the injuries because of the dog bite and she could not be cured despite availing the treatment. He has cited many an example to bolster the stand that there should be a fact finding authority in this regard and thereafter the Court may advert to the issue whether apathetic attitude by the State would give rise to a remedy in public law.

5. Mr. Basant, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the State of Kerala has refuted the submissions with all vehemence at his command and would contend that such kind of injuries or death would not come within the violations of any kind of public order inviting the wrath of public law remedy or for that matter giving room to agitate the grievance by taking recourse to the public law remedy.

6. We think it apt, as advised at present, that the deliberation with regard to duty of the State in this regard should wait for some time but the grievances agitated by Mr. Biju with agony, vehemence and sometimes with enthusiasm, cannot be ignored.

7. We have taken assistance of Mr. Dave, learned Amicus Curiae and Mr. V. Giri, learned Senior Counsel who belongs to the State of Kerala. In our considered opinion, a committee should be constituted as per prayer No. (ii) of the interlocutory application and accordingly, we constitute a committee consisting of the following members:

1. Mr. Justice Siri Jaga, formerly a Judge of the High Court of Kerala.

2. The Secretary, Department of Law, State of Kerala.

3. The Director of Health Services, Government of Kerala.

8. The Committee shall entertain the complaints with regard to the injuries sustained by the persons in the dog bite, the nature and gravity of the injury, availability of medicines and the treatment administered to them, the failure of treatment and its cure and in case of unfortunate death, the particulars of the deceased and the reasons behind the same. The Committee shall also identify the centres/hospitals where the anti-rabies vaccines are available free of charge.

9. On such facts being recorded, this Court, subject to adjudication of the responsibility of the State, would be in a position to think of granting of compensation or making certain arrangements. We are absolutely certain that without the fact finding enquiry, this Court will not be in a position to deal with the compensation facet.

10. The Committee shall be given the secretarial assistance, as required and it will be at liberty to avail the assistance of any authority and call for materials from any source as it thinks advisable. Needless to say, it shall follow the principles of natural justice.

11. As the former Judge has to travel from place to place, whenever requisitioned, he shall be provided a vehicle by the State of Kerala so that the enquiry can be facilitated. The learned Judge shall be entitled to an honorarium of ` 60,000/- (Rupees sixty thousand only) per month for the present. Let the first report be submitted to this Court within 12 weeks hence.

12. At this juncture, we are obligated to deal with the first prayer put forth in the interlocutory application. Mr. Biju, learned Counsel would submit that unless ex gratia amount is granted, the family is not in a position to sustain itself because the wife was working in the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS) and the husband is a bus driver and he has two young children. Though the prayer has been opposed by Mr. Basant, learned Senior Counsel with singularity of conviction, we think it apt to direct the Respondent-State of Kerala to pay a sum of ` 40,000/- (Rupees forty thousand only) to the applicant within four weeks hence. We hereby make it clear that this kind of application shall not be entertained henceforth because we have already constituted a Committee as a fact finding authority and hence, any person intends to avail this kind of remedy has to move the Committee and not directly come to this Court or move the High Court. Let the matter be listed on 12.07.2016.

1. Having heard Learned Counsel appearing for the parties and taking into consideration the seriousness of the issue involved in this matter, we deem it appropriate to pass the following directions:

""1. The Secretary, Ministry of Women and Child Development, Government of India, will be the nodal officer to co-ordinate the efforts for preventing children going missing, tracing out the missing children, and for the resettlement and rehabilitation of children in child care institutions.

2. The Secretary, Ministry of Women and Child Development, Government of India, will co-ordinate with his/her counterparts in all the States and the Union Territories in respect of directions issued by this Court and obtain necessary information from them as required by this Court from time to time instead of having separate affidavits filed by the States and the Union Territories in this Court thereby burdening the record of this Court.

3. Insofar as the website viz., www.trackthemissingchild.gov.inis concerned, it is stated that website is in operation since the year 2012. We request the Director, Faculty of Management Studies, University of Delhi, Delhi, to appoint some competent members of the 'said Faculty and if necessary to take outside assistance to study the aforesaid website and to suggest improvements, if any, at the earliest.

4. It appears that many States have prepared their own Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to trace out missing children. Some of these SOPs are in line with the SOP framed by the NALSA. The Secretary, Ministry of Women and Child Development, Government of India, will make a compilation of all these SOPs and hand them over within a week from today to the Director, Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai. We request the Director of TISS to set up a group to study all these SOPs and to come out with a model SOP which would then be distributed to all the States and the Union Territories for implementation.

5. The Secretary, Ministry of Women and Child Development Government of India, will inform this Court on the next date of hearing whether the Advisory Committee mandated under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2000, has been set up in all the States and the Union Territories and if so, the details of meetings held by them.

7. The Secretary, Ministry of Women and Child Development, Government of India, will also issue directions immediately to his/her counterparts in all the State Governments and the Union Territories to vigorously renew efforts to trace out the missing children.""

The affidavits filed by some of the State Governments/Union Territories indicate that the efforts of the State Governments/Union Territories have been quite fruitful over the last couple of months but that should not result in the State Governments/Union Territories becoming slack in this regard. The renewed efforts and implementation of Operation Smile should be made for a full one month at least so that maximum number of missing children are traced out.

2. The Secretary, Ministry of Women and Child Development, Government of India, will file an affidavit indicating the result of the efforts made by the State Governments/Union Territories in this regard on or before 13.02.2015. The said affidavit will also indicate whether the Advisory Committees have been set up by all the State Governments and the Union Territories as well as the efforts made by Union of India to fill up the vacancies in the NCPCR. The time for filing the affidavit will not be extended.

3. We request the Director, Faculty of Management Studies, University of Delhi, Delhi, to try and complete the study of the website viz., www.tracktherriissingchild.gov.in before the next date of hearing and submit a report to this Court on or before 13.02.2015. Similarly, we request the Director of TISS to inform us about the progress made in formulation of a Standard Operating Procedure to trace out and handle the cases of missing children on or before 13.02.2015.

4. We also find from the affidavits filed by the various States/Union Territories that a large number of police officers are involved in the process of tracing out missing children and many of those police officers have been appointed as Child Welfare Officers/Juvenile Welfare Officers. We find that there is nothing to indicate whether these police officers have been given training of any kind either in terms of awareness, sensitization of child rights or for tracing out the missing children.

5. Under the circumstances, we request the Director, National Police Academy, Hyderabad to consult with the police authorities across the country and to come out with a standard curriculum and a training module(s) for imparting training to the police officers and sensitizing them about the issue and to trace out the missing children as well as to prevent human trafficking, child labour and other vices that go along with the exploitation of missing children. We request the Director to try and complete the exercise on these issues and send a report to this Court on or before 13.02.2015.

6. The Director of the Faculty of Management Studies, the Director of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences and the Director of the National Police Academy will, no doubt, appreciate that the request is being made on behalf of a large number of voiceless missing children.
